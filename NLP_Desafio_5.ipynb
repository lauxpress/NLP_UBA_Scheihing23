              "'Gorgeous color and great price, but too low cut and because of the design, a cami\\'s wouldn\\'t work. disappointed I love the way the dress fit definitely a flip flop by the poolside bar dress. i ordered the mango colored one and was disappointed that the color resembled a dark squash orange and not as bright as it looked in picture. i think it will look nice with a tan so i will keep it. wouldn\\'t plan to dress it up too much because it will definitely wrinkle ! i am a petite 5\\'4 and got the regular and it fits just above my knees which is good for my taste! This is a lovely blouse. i think is a bit roomy, but even so, i like the look. i have to dress business casual for work and this blouse fits the bill as it\\'s not too casual. An excellent going out to dinner, to a lounge, etc. piece. super flattering, sexy, feminine and trendy! can be dressed up or down with some nice accessories. i\\'m only 5 feet and very wary of jumpsuits, but this was excellent! I was looking forward to this cute top to get me through the winter, but the combination of the very think fabric and boxy shape did not work on my 5\\'2\", 130 lb, 34d figure. the one i received also had an open unfinished seam beneath the zipper. i imagine this would be a great top for someone taller. Loved almost everything about this top. the colors are great, comfortable fit, but the length was a little too long for my 5\\'4 frame. i also wasn\\'t a big fan of the large side slit. i would still recommend this great top. I have mixed feelings about htis top, it is a nice shape and comfortable, fits triue t o size, but hte fabric is thin adn sheer. i decided to keep in mind if it goes on sale. the 0 fit me perfectly. (115 lbs, 3-dd chest). Don\\'t wait. get this dress now before it disappears. it is gorgeous, it is well made. it is like butter. the fit is perfect and the workmanship is stunning. everything about this screams, \"lets go party!.\" oh yeah... and the skirt part kind of swishes around as you dance. you cannot get more charming than this. I thought this skirt would fit just over the knee with a nice flowy build. instead it fit rather baggy and was longer than i expected. i felt dowdy in it. This is a great sweater. great color and style. i love that it\\'s a little retro. can be worn with jeans and tights. highly recommend. it does run a little big, but not by a lot. It\\'s sheer, the design /print is casual, but on silk like material. had it been made out of cotton would have definitely kept it! who is going to wear this in the blazing heat of summer??? The price is high and i have to dry clean this? no thanks. These shorts are divine. the fabric is sturdy and there is a weave of sparkle that i did not perceive from the picture. I\\'m 5\\'7, 125lbs, and the small fits perfectly. the sleeves are the right length (i have long arms and legs), and the body fits loosely, without looking sloppy. at my height, the small is not long enough to wear as a tunic, which is fine.\\r\\n\\r\\nunfortunately, the shirt arrived with makeup stains around the laces and the inside of the shirt, so i had to wash it before wearing it.\\r\\n\\r\\ni only purchased this shirt because it was on sale. I had high hopes for this top. i love the plaid and design but found it too boxy and short. the front was cut too low as well. I bought this dress for an early fall wedding, i usually wear a size 14 and bought a large. it was loose and swingy, very comfortable, almost too big. i would size down if you are in between. this dress was so easy to wear, i would definitely bring it on vacation. you can pair any type of shoes- flats, sandals, heels, wedges would all look good. This top is very pretty and you can definitely wear it without a cami with a nude bra if you\\'re an outgoing person, especially for a summer evening. my only confusion is the too high neckline. if it was just a little lower, it would look and feel less \"chokey.\" i keep wanting to pull it down. i\\'m a size 0 and needed the xxs which fits like most people\\'s xs\\'s as sizing continues to get bigger. really lovely except for the neckline. looks great over white or colored shorts and is a nice mix of cas I was extremely disappointed with the quality of this product. as soon as i put this tunic, the right tie loop detached from the garment. i could return it but the point of shopping online was to avoid the hassle of going to the store. the price of the item does not justify the low quality of the final product. Pretty design and good quality but the medium was very balloony at the bottom. fit my chest alright (34c) but flared out way too much at the bottom. Wow the mixed reviews on this dress would make someone not get it at all.\\nit is true to size. i\\'m a 6 and the six fit as a glove on me.\\nthe material is not at all stiff. i actually wished it was a bit more structured. but that didn\\'t bother me.\\ni was able to close the zipper by myself.\\ni\\'m 5\\'7\" 144lb 36a.\\nthe top feels confortable to me as well. i don\\'t considered myself curve like jlo but i have hips. the dress does not make me feel bigger at all.\\nthe only down side is that it looks more expens This shirt was so weird?it does not fit like the photo at all. there seems to be missing a stitch or something at the top as it is wide open until the bottom/where it meets the other layer. i could wear a tank/camisole underneath, but it still just did not fit right. i do not have a large chest, but this was ridiculous. beyond that, the red color was just okay. even though i purchased this on sale, it was not worth the price and i returned. Tried it on at the local store today, it is very pretty! i believe i runs large. i am usually a small, but they only had an xs and it fit perfectly. it is made of thick linen and has a lining. This is a beautiful blouse that runs one to two sizes too small. i usually wear an 8, maybe a 10 on a bad day. i couldn\\'t get into the 8, the 10 was uncomfortably tight, and even the 12 was snug (i haven\\'t worn a size 12 anything since i was pregnant years ago). i think this blouse would look best on a woman without any curves as it adds curves to any woman\\'s body. since i already have curves, i felt like jessica rabbit in this blouse. it was too much for me. again, lovely blouse, but i would no Unlike the other reviewer, i found this skirt to run small...very small. i am pear-shaped and always wear a 12 or size 31. the size 12 in this could barely go over my hips and was very snug around the waist. another inch in the zipper would be nice! there is no spandex in this skirt - just cotton - so there isn\\'t any give to the fabric either. i ordered the size 14, which fit like a glove, but i would really like to see if the 16 would be better. embarrassing but i am just worried that with 100% I love the look of this sweater and was so happy with how it looked and felt when i first tried it on, but within a day of wear, i noticed significant pilling, which made it appear much older / worn. This sweater is really cute, and comfortable - but the color is a tad off from the picture. it\\'s a deeper blue than i was expecting, and the pocket is not a \"rust\" color as depicted online. it\\'s definitely closer to red. other than that, i still do like it - the speckles are a nice touch, and it is true to size, and not too short. I ordered this skirt hoping i could wear it to work as it looked tailored on the model. this skirt is made from a heavy material but flares out. it is a whole lot of skirt! i\\'m 5\\'2\" and short waisted it looked like i was getting swallowed up.  i love the colors and design but it just overwhelmed me. it would work on someone taller. Very cute dress, but fabric is very flimsy and seams were very puckered which couldn\\'t be pressed out. If i stopped eating for a couple of months or jumped into a time machine and set the dial for 1990 i would really enjoy this beautifully made delicate blouse. the problem area is evident looking at the photo --the tiny tight fitted gorgeous bodice. i will keep this piece becasue i love it so and the apocolypse is apparently imminent and i have hardly any food in the house. This jacket is beautiful! the embroidery is very well done! the jacket is fully lined in black. i usually wear a l/xl and definitely needed the xl as it runs a little small. This is a great fall boho dress. you can dress up or down depending on the shoes. looks great with boots! but definitely size down!! So, this is just the most lovely romper. beautifully made, flowey. very comfortable, until you have to take it off.\\r\\nthis is the review i posted on facebook. \\r\\nso, no man i know has ever ever ever experienced the abject terror, or maybe has not shared with me, that moment when you cannot get out of, because it has turned into a straight jacket, that otherwise cute romper. and again, maybe a man invented it! Boxy, short & wide! luv this brand but super disappointed with this design... Was excited to receive this dress as i got it at a great price on sale. the colors are great and it fits pretty good, but it came without a slip!!  so disappointing to not receive the entire dress!!  hence the 2 stars. may send it back for this reason. Purchased this item on sale-received it and it had two huge holes on the side.not possible to repair. very disappointed in lack of quality control. :( Tried this on on a whim and so glad i did, it is lovely! i can\\'t wait for next summer now as i\\'ll definitely wear this as a dress with a light cardigan. seems tts (34d and 5\\'2\", i bought in a small and it fits nicely). a bit pricey for what it is ($68 or $58 would have been more appropriate i think) so try to get it on sale :) I ordered the green/teal in size xl. the fit on me doesn\\'t match the model. it looks looser on her. i think it runs small, at least in size xl. it still is a comfortable fit since the material has stretch. the pleat at the top helps the drape of the shirt. it\\'s a beautiful color of green too. i think the v-neck is too low so i wear a tank underneath. this also helps with the transparent panels at the shoulders/back. my other dolan tops have held up well and retained their color through washing s These are fantastic, great fit, super comfortable material and perfect length (petite). i ordered the carbon to have a neutral pair, but i also want the other colors! 0p fit 26.5 in waist, 115 lbs. length on petite is enough to have a small heel) i have short legs). Too pricey for the quality of this imported product. This reminded me of big bird in person and just adds volume to your body. i\\'m thin and usually wear a size 0, so i\\'m not sure who this may look good on. I knew i needed to buy this trench from the moment i saw it on my computer screen, but something prompted me to stop by my local retailer and try it on first. thank goodness for that.\\r\\n\\r\\nat first glance, i knew i wouldn\\'t be buying this. the construction leaves much to be desired. from the flimsy, single layer of unlined, unstructured fabric, to the thin strip of fabric serving as a belt, i could easily see this being sold at a cheap store for teenage girls where throwaway clothes are a dim This is a cute dress, it fits well. i have a bust do it\\'s not as \"loose\" as it is on the model. runs short. i\\'m 5\\'8\" solid size 10 I like this top. another reviewer mentioned that it was a great top for a busty girl...i agree. i\\'m a 32g and could have sized down to a small, but i kept the medium because i wanted the extra length to have the option of wearing it as a dress. the small may have caused slight button pulling, but since the fabric has stretch and the top has a generous cut, it wouldn?t look insane. my only issue is the fabric pills. i wore the top once, and the fabric near the armpit pilled a lot, especially for I purchased this jumpsuit for christmas parties this year and have received so many compliments. it\\'s a great fit and very comfortable. i especially love the pockets! very flattering. I was excited to receive this top. it looked great online, vibrant colors with the beautiful detail on the sleeves. when i tried it on, the fabric looked and felt cheap. it is not a flowy top. do not recommend it. I\\'m so bummed! i absolutely loved the pair of these i bought in the bronze color great fit, great color, so comfortable! however, i just washed them and could tell right away when i laid them flat to dry that they had lost color in areas where they had wrinkled in the wash machine. so, now they have strange lighter lines running along them. not acceptable. \\r\\n\\r\\ni will say that the two lighter colors may not have this issue. for reference, see my stats. i bought a 26. Love this shirt. i have it in black.  i have a larger chest, but i don\\'t feel like the seams hit me wrong.  this is super cute and swingy.  i however think the price is way too high for a think cotton tee. I\\'m tall (5\\'11\" and busty) and found this top to run on the short side. as others have said, the material is soft and stretchy, but the rouching created a bit of a bulky look. i returned it. Perfect for work or going out. i layered this with the reversible tank in medium pink so it would be work appropriate. it did not feel scratchy to me, maybe because i layered it. great buy especially with the discounts. feel like i lucked out. Cute print on both sides, but far more \"cheek\" was exposed than i anticipated from the photos. the front isn\\'t too skimpy, but the back is a bit too small for my taste. definitely narrower in the back than a standard bikini cut. too bad :( the matching top is my favorite top, so i guess i\\'ll just have to wear black bottoms with it. I bought this during a 20% off sale which made it even more worth the price. i would have purchased and kept it regardless, but just got lucky.\\n\\nlooking at the pictures online, i thought the coat was going to be red. however; when it showed up it is more purple. i still like the color and did end up keeping the coat.\\n\\ni do think the buttons are sewn on well, but i was surprised it did not come with additional buttons in case one gets lost. these are very unique buttons so i can\\'t imagine it woul I love this top, but i do need to wear a navy cami underneath.  as the pic shows, the lace in the mid section makes it completely sheer in place... kinda odd placement in my opinion. but if you don\\'t mind the sheerness or a cami, it\\'s a great top. I liked it online, but i didn\\'t want to pay shipping for something i wasn\\'t sure if it is good. when i saw one size 4 in the store, i was excited to try it on. however, it didn\\'t quite meet the expectation. the dress fits a little loose (donna morgan size 2 fits me better), and it is not lined at all. the separate top piece is just way too big without any shape. there must be a clip on the back of the top shown on the model to make it look smaller. i love the blue floral print, but that is the o This shirt is way too flowy and the pink color is extremely washed out- will definitely be returning! I\\'m 5\\' 5\", 150 lbs, 32dd, normally a 28p or 29p in pants. i ordered an 8 and probably should have gone with a 10. it was super unflattering?the print was overwhelming for my pale skin, it made my thin waist look larger than it really was, and rode up the inside of my thighs. i have a similar bathing suit from modcloth that\\'s 1/3 of the price and 20x as flattering. if you have thick legs, this may not be the suit for you. i returned it--so fast. .unfortunately it hit at the widest part of my hips, so it wasn\\'t very flattering. the point in the back was also kind of odd, and off center. i had to return. pretty color, though. I do not understand all the great reviews but that goes to show everyone likes different things! the jacket looks great in the pictures but in person, it just looks awful! gray is one of my favorite colors but this color is so drab and the material looks old and worn. it definitely has a grunge look to it and overall, it is just a wrinkly mess. another reviewer said it looks like old clothes and i have to agree. it looks very shabby. it also reminds me of those smocks they have at the hair salon Bought this cami/tank on sale which i\\'m glad but it has a flap underneath like a bralette but not fitted..it kinda just drapes under the cami...the problem is it\\'s not thick enough to offer the coverage you would want under a white tank ...but it was also too short so it caused a visible line underneath that showed through.that was higher than the bottom of my chest ..so it gave the appearance that i wore the wrong bra/undergarment...it simply looks awkward ...not sure if it would\\'ve been better It is soft and hangs great. problem - i wore it one time - and the back balled up terrible. it looked like i had owned it for years - not worn it one time. wouldn\\'t recommend. though it is sooooo soft! What a great purchase! love this vest. i live in pa and i see myself wearing this sweater for 3 seasons, which i love. great details, length, and knit. true to size I love it. the fabric is a heavier denim and it has a nice stretch. being tall i appreciate the length. the sizes run a bit large; i\\'m usually a 10/12 but the 8 is perfect. Beautiful - ordered a s, i wear a 2 in most retailer items. hand washed in cold water, shrunk inches, yes inches! love maeve clothing, this shirt is gorgeous. before hand washing in the sink, it was large and flowy. now it barely fits. Uncomfortable in the leg area, but otherwise very flattering. These pants look nice and are comfortable but the quality of the fabric is terrible! i should not be surprised because i bought another pair of pants by this same label at antro earlier this year and they did not hold up at all either. but i thought i\\'d give it another shot. never again! i\\'m on my 5th wear and the crotch and inner thighs have worn away completely...i mean huge holes in the fabric where it\\'s just disintegrated. even at extra % off the sale price it\\'s not worth it. the full price I really like this jacket! it runs big, so you may want to size down. the fabric was softer than i was expecting, but i really like it. very cute fall jacket! This dress is one of a kind! i saw it on sale and immediately snatched it for a very reasonable price. i could not be happier. i\\'ve already had the chance to wear it at an event and felt like miss mary from downton abby. very classy and elegant. I was looking for a dress that was short sleeved but not sleeveless. this fit my needs--not too short, nice v neck (but not deep), pretty embroidery overall i like the dress. here are a couple of downsides--i wore the dress with tights--and due to the nature of the fabric (cotton) there was no \\'glide\\' and therefore it rode up with the tights. also, it\\'s a bit wide int he mid section. i wanted an \\'easy\\' and not tight/form fitting dress, but this does have almost too much fabric in the mid section Love a gray sweater and this one is stunning. layered with a plaid tunic and worn to work, with many compliments. the only downside is the poncho shape, with the large wing like sleeves, makes it impossible to wear a coat over this sweater. if you wanted to wear in the winter cold, you would need a cape. also not an ideal piece if you need to lift your arms for any reason. keeping that in mind though, i still really like it for days when i want to look cute and won\\'t be don\\'t a ton of moving aro This top looks much nicer on the model than in-person. i tried it on, it didn\\'t look flattering and was shorter than i like. in the picture i really like the top with the design and frills on the side, gives the model a waist. in-person the design doesn\\'t stand out much and the frills look wrinkled.it is also sweatshirt material and a tad stiff. i am sending it back. it just didn\\'t look as flattering. also, it seemed more fitted at the top than bottom. Love this dark gray heathered blazer ( no stripes, contrary to its name)! very easy to wear with the bit of spandex, and not hot or heavy like my tailored wool blazers. i am usually a petite medium but decided to order petite large to better accomodate layers or sweaters, sleeve length perfect even with sweater on. will get lots of wear with this dress-up or dress-down piece! I ordered these because of the side zipper, but they zip in front, even though the order listing and bag label called them \"wine, side zip pants.\" they were also at least two sizes larger than marked and very flimsy material. what bothers me is that i was charged $5.95 to send them back, even though the product description (and the name before someone changed it on the website) were wrong. So i\\'m not sure if its just my body type or what, but this did nothing for me. the bottom, which i thought would be too big was actually too small in both the small and the medium (i\\'m a size 8 bottom) and then when i sized up to the medium it was still too tight and then the top was loose. i just think this one is going to take the right body type. it could look really beautiful on the right person, just not me. I keep trying to find a peplum that works for me, but so far i have been unsuccessful. i just do not think that my shape and the peplum shape play well together?aside from the peplum issue, this shirt had a massive amount of material and runs large. the material alone is thick, making it a bulkier shirt, then add the volume of the peplum and i looked (and felt) huge. needless to say, this one was returned, sale or no sale. The armholes on this dress are totally bizarre. i can\\'t believe no one else has commented on them yet. i am a size s on top and m on the bottom so i usually try on both in dresses. i tend to be a small/ size 6 in retailer. the armholes are so long that the dress doesn\\'t lay right on top. i showed it to on of the clerks in the store and she agreed with me. we looked at all the others and they were the same. going up a size made it way worse. this dress might work for someone with really broad shoul I snagged this the first day i wore it with my wedding ring. it is very delicate and i can\\'t wear it when i\\'m with my kids because they pull on it so much! it will just me by night out wrap i guess!!! If you have a love for vintage, romantic, feminine attire, this is the dress for you. it evokes memory of days gone by. it isn\\'t just beautiful, the quality is superb. make sure you check the measurements for this little beauty has so stretch to it. There isn\\'t much shape to this dress. it\\'s fairly straight from top to bottom. i\\'m smaller on top with a small waist but slightly pear shaped. the top half was somewhat loose but the bottom half just clung too much. i\\'m 5\\'2\" and 107 lbs and bought a pxs for reference. also, i wore a tee shirt underneath and the dress shed all over it. Not for the curvy women. fit in the waist but bunched around the crotch The sleeves on this top always caught my eye every single time i was in a store. they never had my size to try on, so when a free shipping offer came up, i ordered the ivory top in a size large. well, the sleeves are indeed stunning, but that is all that is attractive about this top! the rest was a plain, blank, white canvas. in fact, that\\'s what it felt like to wear it -- like i was wearing a tent or an artist\\'s canvas on my chest. yuck! how can this designer put so much thought and care into t I ordered this skirt because it looked cute and versatile. when it arrived the pleat in front (shown in the center) was far to the right so the overall look was crooked. not sure if it was a quality control issue or if that\\'s the true design but it will have to go back. too bad because i had high hopes! I might be the only odd person out there who think this jacket is not perfect at all. a lot of other reviewers said that the jacket runs small. for me, it\\'s not true at all, i had to go to xxp petite to find the fit acceptable, but it was simply too short (rather than 20\" as it states on the website, it\\'s more like 18\"), which is a thing i almost never experienced because i am a petite person! i don\\'t even want to go regular size because it would\\'ve been too big. i saw some photos that others po Comments. the detail is lovely - especially the dragonflies on the sleeve. and the quality is there with the lining. trouble is this is thick fabric cut in a box shape. imo, you have to be very skinny to pull this off and not look like a tank. i looked at the model (after purchasing) and notice that she has it open and swept back a bit bc if it is not, it is terribly unflattering. This is a beautiful kimono but just isn\\'t made well. the one i received already had a couple small holes and a pull in the thread that was very noticeable. after reading the additional reviewer who wore it an hour and it was already pilling, it is going back for good. such a shame! Nothing wrong with the dress, sadly it\\'s the body i\\'m putting it on that\\'s less than perfect. fits fine and tts, but just doesn\\'t do anything for my bit wide hips, other than adds to them. hangs nicely, but jersey top and nylon bottom add to the wide hip issue. that said, i think i may still keep it as its a great length (not too short) and a nice, simple dress. really versatile. I recently wore this to a beach wedding, and it worked out great with a cute denim jacket. the orange color is pretty and vibrant, and it is comfortable to wear. i like the length of it, and it flows really well as you walk. the cons are that it wrinkles really easily; i used a steamer extensively when it arrived to steam out the wrinkles, but it still had a wrinkled look to it because i think of how the seams are. as i got back up from sitting down for 10-15 minutes, the front and back were alr I love this top! it\\'s so hard for me to find conservative, comfortable and yet not mom-isn swimsuits. this top is amazing. it\\'s comfortable and soft and great quality. i\\'m excited to use this suit this season! First of all, the colors are really pretty, fabrics feel really nice. but.... the fit was no bueno. i think if you are tall and small chested, this dress would look great. but i\\'m short and large chested and it was very unflattering. when the fabric transitions from the stripes to solid, it doesn\\'t hang nicely due to my chest. sadly this is a return for me. Contrary to the first review, there is a zipper so while it wasn\\'t easy to get on, it did fit over my bust. i found this too small and high waisted, and i already have a high waist so i can imagine it looking empire waisted on a normal torso. what i hated was the ridiculous inverted pleat in the front of the dress which is almost impossible to see in the online photo. it made my already busty frame even wider and more unflattering. the lining was nice and soft and the sleeve length and hemline l Goes well with lots of skirts and pants, including the culottes shown. only downside, and not a big one, the sleeves are finished with elastic instead of a fabric band, which looks a little cheap These are beautiful pants! the wine color is rich and they are very soft. they just run really small. i normally wear a 25 regular but often i have to roll the length up a bit. so, this time i ordered a 25p thinking it would be the same just shorter -- but i could hardly even pull them over my slinder size 6 foot. i am going to exchange them for a 26 regular. i so hope that they fit -- they are so lovely!!\\ni totally recommend -- just order a size, or maybe two, up. though, to be fair, maybe peti I had seen this online a few times and while it caught my eye because of the color, i never really bothered to check out the details due to the stock photo. it looks quite bland as it doesn\\'t really flatter the model. however, once i saw this dress in-store, i was drawn to it immediately. the dress is well made, the embroidery is delicate and beautiful with interesting design features. i love the combination of the summer dress with a collar. it makes this dress so work appropriate as well as it Given the price, i was pretty disappointed by the quality of the fabric. the dress falls nicely and fits well, but the fabric is cheap... i have another maxi dress that i bought for like 20 bucks at store on the boardwalk and it has the same fit and fabric. \\r\\n \\r\\ni expect a lot more from a dress with this price. i\\'d recommend only buying on super-sale. This coat is very nice. it\\'s soft and the colors are great. the only reason i gave it a 4 stars and not 5 is that it runs huge! i normally wear a size small to medium in tops and i like a bit of moving room in my coats so i ordered a medium. when i put it on i just started laughing. it was so huge. i wanted to exchange it for an xs to see if that would have been small enough but it has already sold out in that size. i think this could be a big win for larger sizes but unfortunately for me it did I have several lilka pj bottoms and i\\'m glad to add these ones with the adorable bird print to my collection! tts, soft flannel, striking colors, only wish they had pockets! This is definitely a personal preference review. i loved this dress when i tried it on. it\\'s really beautiful. however, there was just way too much fabric on the sleeves for me. i know it\\'s the style and i have similar style dresses, but i felt really large in this dress and it all came down to the sleeves for me. The sweater material was fragile. there were already two picks in the fabric when it arrived. i felt like it would not wear or wash well. i was also disappointed in the shaping or how it hung on my body. i am returning the sweater. Frustrated that the details don\\'t mention there\\'s a side zip. for whatever reason, i have the hardest time fitting into dresses with side zips and so i was annoyed that the details say it\\'s a pull-on style when that\\'s not the case. there\\'s also no give in the waist. besides the fit not working for me, it was a pretty dress but overall a little too much going on. I saw this dress in the retailer store and fell in love with it. tried it on, and even though i was wearing jeans and desert boots, the dress looked terrific! it\\'s great, can obviously be dressed up or down, a wonderful addition to my wardrobe! thanks retailer! I love the style of this swimsuit on the model. when i purchased is i didn\\'t realize that there was no support (wire/ padding/ lining) in the chest. the rest of the swimsuit was great but i did not like the look in the chest - it provided no support. i ended up returning it. Purchased these recently and loved the fit and feel upon trying them on. i was hoping that unlike linen pants, they\\'d keep their shape. no such luck. after an hour or two in them they were hanging and sagging. this is after being a (good) snug fit. i purchased my usual size and i\\'d say they stretched at least a size or two bigger. the color and feel of these is very nice and i see them being perfect for a very casual or slightly dressier outfit so i do recommend them. however, buy them small bec I was excited to order this sweater. when it arrived, the green didn\\'t stand out as much as the picture here. it also felt too itchy. i usually wear either very soft wool or wool with cashmere because i can\\'t stand plain thick heavy wool. this one was just too itchy for me, it is going back. This top looks great with a long straight skirt (the grey with a black skirt....) and skinny jeans. i can understand why the style might not work for everyone but for me it\\'s a perfect blend of elegant and funky. i\\'m sometimes a medium sometimes a large and the medium work well for me, so if in doubt size down This dress was a disappointment. not black, but brown. and it was very oddly made, with a weird, seam right across the belly. on its way back... Love the fit of this top, love the design. it does fit a bit small which was a pleasant surprise considering the sizes don\\'t go as small as i usually have to. i got the smallest size and its pretty tight. its a revealing/low cut top, which is great for minimal tan lines. negative- threads are coming out all over after one wear. but i love it so much i will probably order again once it falls apart.. not so great considering the price though. I really wanted to love this top! it\\'s cute and fitted- fits well, but just hit me a tad higher than i wanted. i tried a size 2 and it fit perfectly--but with no extra room. i\\'m 5\\'5\"-34c. normally wear a 2. It is very sheer which is too bad because the design is super cute. I have several maeve dresses that fit really well. this was not the case with this dress. fabric and color are great! fit was off especially in top. worst part was zipper that wouldn\\'t move smoothly. took me a good 15 minutes to get it unzipped. such a bummer! It does run large as most reviewers noted. i opted for the pxs and it was still very large and the way that the elastic at the top hit me it bunched funny and made my chest look huge and i\\'m only a b cup. it added a good two cup sizes to my chest and it just looked odd. the length of the petite was good for me at only 5\\'4\" so the length did not overwhelm but the width was still really too wide. love the fabric and the lace at the hemline. it just wasn\\'t for me but for those it works for it is be I tried this dress on on a whim and will definitely be getting it! the fit was perfect as it is not to structured so its really a more relaxed piece even though it doesnt look it... but the way you feel when you wear it is just magical!! i love this dress!!! Love this dress! just wore it last night to an early valentine\\'s dinner. very classy, simple, but gorgeous. i\\'m a size 2 in just about everything but i always buy a size 4 in retailer dresses because i\\'m tall (5\\'9\") and have broad shoulders and a long torso, and sizing up in dresses works better all around. i am also not busty (32b). i did get this in a 4. this dress was a little awkward at first trying to hook and then zip but once i got that down it worked. the hook is right up under your I had tried this on in the beige & loved it but could not find it in my size so i got it in the pink.\\r\\ndid not look at good as the beige. I wouldn\\'t be so unhappy if these pants cost about 75% less. they are so cheaply constructed. one wash and they\\'re all but guaranteed to shrink. the material is so cheap and flimsy not at all what i expect from retailer. they are also 32 inch inseam not 35.5 as stated on the web site which is the whole reason i bought them. Why does the lining stop at mid thigh when the skirt is long? makes product look cheap while wearing. love the color, the fabric, and the fit, but cant get past this less than quality feature - will be returning. Facing the mirror--near perfection. high waist emphasizes the narrowest part of the frame--pleats nicely hide any stomach flaws. color is an eye-catching deep mustardy perfection and the interlocking button pattern is creative and beautiful. the problem is the walk away. from that view, the skirt waist finishes just where there\\'s a bit of extra flesh. the cut is more of a long a-line--fairly boxy--and the heaviness of the cotton maintains that structure, so while the look as you approach walking I was surprised how soft and comfy the fabric is on this top. when i tried it on, i didn\\'t want to take it off! it\\'s a little bigger than i would like - i got a small, and am usually between xs and s. may have sized down if the top were available.but the fit and cut are flattering. Love the design and style of this dress when i saw it online, however, it falls a little short once in person. it was a bit boxier than i wanted and the lines didn\\'t make it appear as a swing dress, highlighting your figure.\\n\\ni wish this could have worked, however, it felt a little too unshapely. I wanted to give this a glowing review but i ended up returning this cardigen. the folds on top added too much to my frame. i do not suggest this for heavier apple shapes. for all others, it is incredibly soft and warm. the tan color was weird but they others are simply gorgeous. I was very disappointed in the quality of this top. the first time i wore it it snagged right in the front. i had to pull the thread under so it wasn\\'t exposed. i put it in the wash in the gentle cycle and it was destroyed with several more snags when i removed it from the machine. this top is extremely delicate and doesn\\'t withstand normal everyday casual wear although it\\'s s casual lightweight sweater. now it\\'s just a wear around the house ratty throw around shirt. Dress is nice but can\\'t be worn without tights or you are at a risk of indecently exposing yourself. it is around 30\" in length so is more of a tunic than a dress. i\\'m only 5\\'1 and it was too short . can\\'t imagine anyone taller even trying to wear this ! This is a lovely dress looks very expensive, nice fabric and detail. i\\'m 6ft tall 160lb. i normally order a l/10 but got an m color black because other sizes were sold out. length wise the dress is a little shorter than it looks on the model, but then again i\\'m pretty tall. you can\\'t really tell on the online photo but this dress has a white undergarment, which makes it great because of the see through detail on the fabric. size wise, i felt like even with an m the dress is oversized. it sits we This is absolutely huge.  it felt like it was at least 2 sizes too big - the empire waist wasn\\'t even semi- fit.  36d chest and size small was like a tent.  however, the embroidery was beautiful I ordered the skirt online and when it arrived i loved the fit and the aesthetic of the skirt. i usually wear a 0/2 bottoms and sized up based on comments- it fits great could maybe even have taken a 6 to have a looser fit.\\n\\ni was however very disappointed when receiving the skirt to see that the material was already highly snagged- how is that possible if coming directly from the warehouse? i\\'m hesitating to return because i consider it already damaged based on the current condition and if it\\'s Really beautiful top. i agree with the others, a bit on the short side. it is cut a little wide but has a nice flow. the color is not pink. it is a blush type color that can be hard to wear for some skin tones, but i\\'m going to make it work because the top is too pretty to pass up. I ordered both colors in size xl and they\\'re each now favorite purchases. the fit is true to size--it matches the photos. the orange/white/brown/red combo works great with the orange version of the indra tassel necklace.\\n\\nthe tops are sheer so i wear a tank underneath. the green floral version will have some variations because of pattern placement. both are so unique & charming! i\\'ve been pairing them with different retailer cardigans & necklaces. they\\'ve washed well too--in a mesh bag on gentle & I tried this on in the store and it was huge. i couldn\\'t try on a smaller size because they only had a 2 and 4. i tried on my usual size 12. i don\\'t think the embroidery is as pretty in person either. definitely not worth the price. The one i tried on had something wrong with the pockets... one was regular height,t eh other was so low, i could barely put my hand in it. however, the jumpsuit itself is really pretty and soft. color is nice, but hard ot pull off on pale skin like me.  i tried on the xs, but that was big. i would need xxs p if it was made in that size, so i let it go... (looked nice with pinched fabric in the back.\\r\\n\\r\\nfor reference i am 115 lbs, 30 dd< 26.5 in waist. I debated getting this top, and i am glad that i did! i got the pink, and it is a fun, vibrant color. someone suggested that if you are in between sizes, go up. i agree with that feeling; however, it is pretty true to size. it is preppy, cute, and classic. I bought one of these tees and i washed it a few times and luckily no holes yet like other reviews have stated. i just got a 2nd tee as they are quite comfy. i bought these both in-store but the petite size might have been better for my frame. i wish retailer would look into having petite sizes available in store and not just online. sometimes i do get lucky on finding petite sizes in-store, but it\\'s usually from a return. On the hanger, this dress looks a bit boxy, however once on, it has a beautiful flow and elegance to it. it\\'s super feminine and cinches in at the waist perfectly. my one (major) complaint that prevented me from purchasing the dress? there\\'s no give to the dress. i wasn\\'t able to lift my arms up past 90 degrees and that\\'s sort of a problem. it\\'s a shame though because the outside shell is gorgeous and so structured, and it would have been a nice contrast to the shape of the dress on a body. I ordered this dress in two sizes, pxs and ps. they both arrived in a timely manner but the pxs was snagged upon arrival. there were a few other reviewers that stated the dress snagged easily but i loved the classic look of this dress so i thought i would take the chance. unfortunately i had to take both back to the store because the potential for snagging the fabric was too high even considering the sale price. also, the dress comes with a cotton slip but the slip for the pxs was tiny while the I sized way down and this top was still shapeless and tent-like. the sweatshirt fabric overpowered the cute, feminine details. Love this top and i think it is a great transition piece - i live in texas, so our temps stay high until october. this top in the purple motif color is perfect, since the colors aren\\'t look too summery, but the fabric is lightweight. this top is a little bit boxy, but drapes nicely so it won\\'t make you look wide. as with most holding horses tops, this runs a little big so size down unless you need the length. I was running low on good summer shorts and thought i\\'d try these based on having a pair of the pilcro cropped pants i got a couple months ago. i tried these shorts on in-store to make sure they fit right and that i liked how they looked but then bought them online (more colors were available in my size than what they had in store). i bought these in 3 different colors and i absolutely love them all! they are my go-to shorts now, they look good with the legs rolled up or down, and i will be wear I was very excited when i saw this in a perk email and immediately went to order it. unfortunately, the stock image of this pullover is misleading. it\\'s boxy (image makes it seem like it\\'s form-fitting) and the weave/mesh is much thicker and open in person. as shown, you do need a cami underneath. i ordered this in a small and medium since it\\'s an online exclusive and there were no other products by on the road to see reviews of to know how their tops fit. i wanted to love this. i didn\\'t think i I love this suit. it is a really cute color way & stripe and the fabric is nice, but... i ordered an xl. i have 20-30 extra pounds on me leftover from my last child. i am currently wearing a 10 or a 12. this suit would be great for a thinner girl, but i could not wear this suit to the family pool. the bottom is cut kind of skimpy and the breast area does not have much support. this xl would be a better fit on an 8-10. it will need to go back. The fabric of this looks and feels so cheap it\\'s hard to believe this is anna sui. i would say this is unwearable. there is zero stretch and it is made of itchy textured poly fabric that looks like novelty fabric at best. going back asap. This is a terrific top!  the supima cotton is super-soft; the black, a deep black.  i love that antho is listening, and that it\\'s made in the usa!  the lines and flow are beautiful and flattering.  i bought the medium and am a reliable size 8 top/medium, 34f.  the sleeves are nice and long.  don\\'t miss out on this classic tee, friends! I got the honey colored and love the color. they are very comfy and soft. i look forward to wearing them all summer I stalked this sold out product for weeks hoping my size would become available. when it did, i was very excited, in fact i ordered both a s and xs to be sure one sweater would fit me! unfortunately, neither did and i felt the actual sweater was not as pictured. the sweater has an overall baggy fit and the cutouts don\\'t fall as neatly and as evenly on both shoulders as the picture shows, making the look a bit sloppy in my opinion. it is such a shame as this look is very of the moment and the mod I tried on this top and it looked fine until i tried to move. you can\\'t lift your arms. i tried on a larger size but still felt like the movement was limited in the back and arm areas. Beautiful blouse - the material is great. long enough to wear over leggings but i\\'ve also worn with my flare jeans. somewhat fitted at the top and then drapes out in a gorgeous way. one of my new favorites. This dress is absolutely adorable. runs true to size, i am five foot nine and a medium fit perfect. the denim has a lot of stretch. i can\\'t wait to wear it in the winter with tights and boots! don\\'t wait too long before this one sells out. This dress is so cute in the photo and fit true to size, but the material is slinky and felt cheap. the stitching was also poor quality. i am so thankful that retailer will let us order a batch, try on and return in store...this went back. Like the previous review said, i was excited to receive this top. i had grand visions of all the ways i could wear it! to my chagrin, when i put it on, it just fell right down and pooled around my waist. i wish there were smaller sizes to order. sadly, this is going back. I\\'ve never owned sweater leggings before so these were my first. i had to order large because well i have some junk in the trunk (am 10/12 on bottom and 8 on top). these are a teeny bit scratchy but i\\'m hoping with a wash they\\'ll soften up--but they\\'re really loose too so i\\'m also hoping they\\'ll shrink a teensy bit. I bought this is a size small, i\\'m 5\\'8\" 140 and the fit it perfect. it is a very pretty red and looks very cute on. i\\'m very happy i bought it but i did buy it on sale otherwise i may have hesitated because of the price. I bought these in the mustard color and the salmon color.  i didn\\'t have a problem with general fading, but used natural, mild stain remover (biokleen) and the pants were ruined. one faded where i sprayed and the other has a permanent water mark.  cold wash and line dried. such a bummer that these pants aren\\'t every day wearable and washable! I usually love bordeaux so i was very disappointed with this shirt when it arrived. the fabric smelled plastic-y which is a first for me with retailer products. when i put the shirt on, i could see it had that sheen that comes from rayon spandex blend shirts, i hadn\\'t noticed that it had spandex in it when i ordered it. this fabric looks and feels exactly like the cheap blends sold at discount stores. i can\\'t believe retailer is selling this. I am so happy i decided to try this on in store. it is absolutely stunning! unfortunately they only had a m and it was a little too flowy so have the s ordered and anxious to try it on. the top is really where i am concerned it is too large. i am 5\\'3\", 36dd and 130#, athletic build. since you really cannot wear a bra with it, which is okay btw, the armholes were a little too open and afraid things may show ;). the bottom fit okay, a little on the large side but this should fit loose and flowy. c Super large and a very weird cut.  the sides were much shorter than the front and back and this just looked awful on me. I love these pants! best fitting pants i\\'ve ever owned. flattering. stretchy/don\\'t stretch out. i am so sad that retailer didn\\'t plan well and stock enough. i bought the black, want the gray and all sizes but 25 and 31 are sold out. i might just buy another black pair so i can have another. i really wish retailer would re-stock these!!!! although these are 5star pants, i rated them a 3 for retailers poor / low stock quantity. I\\'m 5\\'4, 112 pounds. xs petite was a good fit with room for a heavier top. fabric is somewhat picky, so long sleeve is necessary. overall, coat is beautiful and worth the money. nice, unique fall piece. I bought this in the grey as shown in the photo as i\\'m not fond of horizontal stripes and i felt the striping would distract from the floral accent of this tee. the gray is light and as pictured in the photo.\\r\\n\\r\\ni bought an xl and the fit is tailored, with some loose flow to it. it is not boxy or big on me.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe fabric is a soft, soft, thin cotton knit and very cool for hot, muggy summer days....esp. in the southern us where it can be pretty intense. since i bought the gray, it\\'s not sheer, al This is really cute - with a statement necklace or without. jeans or shorts. love it. This dress is awesome - i actually first saw it on lucy lui on elementary and thought it had to be from retailer. sure enough it was and it was on sale. i got the blue and would have gotten both if they had my size. i am usually a m and found this fit true to size. i always love a wrap dress and this with the buttons keeps it from spilling open - love it! This dress is so comfortable and versatile. you can dress it up or down and it\\'s perfect for almost any summer occasion. i have it in the black color and it goes with almost everything! the only complaint i have is the arm holes drop a little too low. you can see part of my bra because of this but it\\'s not too drastic. i\\'m 5\\'4\" with an athletic build and i feel like the petite would have fit me better. regardless, it\\'s a great dress. This is a very sweet/soft sweater, however it runs very large and is very boxy! i would say at least size down 1-2 sizes! i wanted to love them but i had to send it back!! The fold over is so comfy. not the most flattering but really when you are wearing it you are going for comfort i think. bought these on sale and trying to decide if they are worth it or not I really wanted to love this sweater however it fell much shorter on my 5\\'10\" frame than it falls on the model, between my belly button and hip, and the sleeves ended just below my elbow and were much more voluminous than they appear in the product shot. i do have long monkey arms though, so on someone more petite it would probably fit more like the model shot.\\r\\nthe quality of the knit seems nice, however the zipper used is very slim and light weight and got stuck twice just while i was trying i I ordered the blue in size xl. it\\'s even prettier in person. the fit runs a little smaller/shorter on me than shown on the model. i\\'m 5 ft. 5 1/2 in. for reference. i love the detailed stitching. it is delicate and can catch. my dog\\'s claw pulled on it and i had to reweave the thread back. i\\'ve washed mine twice, reshaped & air-dried. it didn\\'t shrink much at all. it\\'s perfect for spring & summer. i\\'ve gotten a lot of compliments on the shade of blue. it\\'s really so pretty. I\\'m glad i tried this on in the store because it runs very large. i usually wear a large and i ended up buying a small. the blue color is very striking. i plan to use it as a cover up and sightseeing dress this summer. This top is very light and soft for summer. even the lace is soft. it\\'s not sheer and doesn\\'t require layering. true to size. i\\'m 5\\'4\", 34dd, 150 lbs- m fits well. my arms are not tiny and yet the lace weren\\'t tight for me. but the quality of the material is average and it feels like it will last barely one summer. it\\'s good if you are paying the sale price. But i didn\\'t like the fit. maybe because i ordered petite and the length threw me off, but they weren\\'t flattering in any way. the color and material were unique and pleasing. had to send them back though. This is a problem i have had with the pilcro hyphen cargos with the color dye.\\r\\nthe dyes in these pants are the same thing. i wore the purple color and washed in cold, gentle, cycle and they were stained/ \\r\\n\\r\\ni will return these -it\\'s too bad because they were pretty comfortable and flattering pants. I really like this romper and i ordered it to fit my bottom. i\\'m a 6 on the bottom and 4 up top. i ordered a mp to cover the bottom and a petite for my height. it\\'s a keeper but i will be belting or adding something to cinch it at the waist so that it has more of a shape. This is a very light, flowy dress. the lining is very fitted, but the dress is actually not fitted. it has a nice flow, but hits right at the thigh area before flowing out. plan to wear it to work.the color is very bright and pretty. I\\'m 5 9 with a slender build but have always found rompers to not be figure flattering.  however this one was perfect! not too short nor long and looks great! highly recommend!! Love this sweater! it\\'s really flattering, long and lean, though not tight, just the right amount of shape and length for my size. i run between and 8 and a 10, and i\\'m about 5\\'8\", i ordered the medium. i love the contrasting knits of the sleeves and body of the sweater. i only wish it came in more colors, i\\'d order it again! So wanted great pair of sweater leggings...great for running errands and keeping the outfit simple. these are not that. these fit very poorly...i ordered the small, which is more like a large one in the waistline...there is nothing to hold these up and i could fit two of me in them. unfortunately, i thought all would be fine and i discarded the receipt and have worn them a few times~ Love this un-basic white top. it\\'s very flattering on, and i love that it\\'s a versatile piece that can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. i am usually a size 8 in maeve tops/dresses, but i found a size 6 fit me a bit better in this particular top. if your\\'e in between sizes, you may need to size down. i definitely recommend this top! This top was originally way overpriced. so i ordered it on sale for half price. still overpriced. it arrived yesterday and frankly i am disappointed. the quality is not great. it is like a jersey type material. doesn\\'t look like the photograph at all. i like the color, but frankly, that\\'s about it. Nice dress fits true to size. beautiful mustard yellow and soft corduroy. These jeans are so comfortable and they are made of the softest fabric. i love that they can be dressed up or down. love these!! I just got this shirt the other day, and already love it. it fits like a basic tee, but the details on the sleeves and back are really cute. the shape is loose at the bottom, which makes this really comfortable.\\r\\nmy only complaint is it\\'s a little tight across the back, but this does not hurt the overall fit and comfort of the top. this is a little thicker than a tee shirt too, so the quality feels nice. For fuller busted folks, this top may not work as it\\'s unstructured and results in a tent from the boobs down. it\\'s a shame--i found the gold embellishment beautiful. I want to like this top because the idea is cute but i ordered the small and it might have well been xxxl.  with sizing like this, one size fits all could just about do it. Didn\\'t like at all. itchy fabric, looked good on model but on on busty girl. Gorgeous details great use of materials -- yet the diagonal seam above the knee at the quadriceps cuts off the muscle and looks odd if you are the least bit muscular. I really wanted to recommend this sweater but honestly can\\'t now. i was attracted to the softness, simplicity and sale price but its longevity ruined it. wrinkles, pills and loses shape quickly. if you still want to get it, consider your shoulders and how knits like this fit on you. this sweater runs tts to large depending on your shoulders and bust size. the styling is excellent--very versatile. but the yarn is too delicate and fussy. I really like this dress. buying it during retailer weekend helps me to like it more. the fabric is lovely. i like the popover styling. its slightly boxy, but not oversized. the sleeves do puff a little bit and i wish they didn\\'t, but that\\'s not a deal breaker. the shoulders are cut a little small, so it can be a challenge to take off. i usually wear a medium or an 8 in most retailer brands. i ordered this in a medium and it fit true to size. I got this dress and the material was super fuzzy and itchy. the prior reviews stated it was \"warm and cozy\" and not itchy at all, but i found it to be uncomfortably so. the dress was true to size for me and the length was good. i loved the plaid in the material just wished the material had been more soft and not rough. the material reminded me of mohair. The skirt part of the dress falls straight and accentuated my stomach. you can\\'t really tell from the pic. but if you have even the slightest bump of a stomach the dress might make it look worse instead of better because of the way that it is cut. i\\'m pretty slim - 5\\'5\\'\\' and 114 pounds and it wasn\\'t doing me any favors! the top of the dress is beautiful! i will exchange it for something else. i ordered it online and couldn\\'t try it on before purchasing it. Very attractive pattern and color. the black is so soft that it seems close to sepia. the length was fine. the fabric, meaning the dress, is quite heavy for not having a lining except just around the bra area---even though the facing didn\\'t successfully substitute for a bra in my opinion. the arm holes are cut in quite a bit so one would have to find the appropriate bra.\\r\\nthe dress runs very large. i ordered an xs petite. it was about 2 inches too large (4 inches total) on either side across the I was excited to order this sweater. when it arrived, the green didn\\'t stand out as much as the picture here. it also felt too itchy. i usually wear either very soft wool or wool with cashmere because i can\\'t stand plain thick heavy wool. this one was just too itchy for me, it is going back. Really liked the styling on this jumpsuit. it looks great on, the lattice back is unusual. i had been looking for a little black jumpsuit for the longest time and this fits the bill. just wish the fabric wasn\\'t polyester. on the down side the top buttons are really hard to put on and take off. if you take care of your nails, it could do a number on them. the bottom buttons are easier. can only imagine a struggle when trying to take this off in an emergency bathroom break! Originally bought the plaid version and retuned it to order this one in the store to get free shipping. the fit is completely different. i am a consistent small, particularly in dresses of this style. will be exchanging this for a medium, which i hope will fit. love the color and pattern. I loved these pants - super soft and cozy and perfect for winter. i\\'ve worn them a handful of times and have washed them maybe twice max and they already have 2 holes! they don\\'t say handwash and my washer/dryer is brand new and pretty gentle on my clothes. maybe i just ended up with a bad pair, but i found the quality to be disappointing :( I was so excited when i ordered this, i love comfy clothing this looked perfect! when i received it, there was a weird smell with the top. convinced that this could be from storage or something, i washed it. the smell did not go away. i have washed it 3 times now and the smell will not disappear! i have not yet worn but as i have washed it, not able to return it. the top looks and feels great - just the weird smell. now i am \\'stuck\\'!! This dress was really odd. i loved the quirky mixture of the blue stripe and the floral but that\\'s about it. the shape was unflattering but honestly that could be because this dress ran large. i was just very underwhelmed with this dress. also the hidden button zipper at the front was an amazing idea but not the best execution. overall its okay just hated it on me. I liked this dress, but had some issues. i am 5\\' 3\" and a 34 d. with small shoulders. the dress was way too big in the shoulders in the 6 i usually wear, so just hung on me funny. otherwise i really liked it. if it weren\\'t for the way it fit me on top (not an unusual problem if you are large busted but have small shoulders) meant i had to return it. I originally purchased these in a size 27 and they were big. i returned them and got a size 26, and they did stretch out after wearing them once - to the point where i could probably have gone done to a size 25. the cut, color, fabric and distressing are great. i am 5\\'3\" and the pants are a tad too long for me to wear them with ankle booties without looking odd. overall, i love these jeans and wear them a lot! Love this dress! the embroidery is stunning and adds to each detail of the dress. i love the pink undertone. it is subtle. it makes it more unique. this is why i love online exclusives. they have that \"one of a kind\" look to them. the quality is great and the style is that there really is no shape to it. it has a nice everyday feel, but along with its elegance, can easily be dressed up as well. priced a little high is my only complaint. I ordered a small, but it was way to big. it was very soft. This top runs large. i am going to return the medium i ordered for a small. \\r\\ni wish it came in different colors. i love the style. I bought these on sale and they quickly went back. i was very disappointed after reading the reviews. i thought for sure these would be a winner. however, i was sadly mistaken. i ordered another pair of jeans, the same, from a different brand. these were way too small while my others were too large. they didn\\'t live up to my expectation and were still rather long. even though i bought these on sale, i was not happy with the quality. Hei hei is my favorite line. i am a medium in all of the pants i have ever purchased from this brand.\\r\\ni ordered these in the green and they arrived today. they fit me as if they were an xxl. i have a similar pair in rust from last summer so i assumed that they would be the same. \\r\\nobviously they are going back tomorrow . i\\'m very disappointed, they are a nice looking jogger and the color is pretty. This top is lovely, but fits like a crop top -- and i\\'m very short-waisted. i wore it with high-waisted jeans and was tugging at it all day. i think it will probably work better with a skirt. the colors are beautiful; it has a nice retro vibe. recommended if you don\\'t mind the crop factor. Oh dear. the elastic waistband just ruined this skirt for me--it made it look so cheap. i assumed from the photograph that the skirt was a knit over a structured lining with a real waistband with a zip. instead, it\\'s a sweatshirt knit with no lining and elastic. it looked cheap and hung a bit baggy from the elastic waist, making it a no-go for me. I own two poodles and love anything poodle print. i was estatic to see this and i snagged it on sale. but it is horrible. the fit is like wearing a pillowcase. it was about 5 inches too wide on each side while the arms fit. it looked like it was attempting to have a dolman shape but it was way too short, wide, and wrong. i was in love with the print however i had to return it. These chinos are really soft and comfortable, but they run really large. i have the 27 petite (5\\'4\" 115 lbs.) and they are too big. i originally bought the 28 petite and exchanged them for the 27 and after wearing the 27s all day i have realized they are significantly too big. they stretch as you wear them so they ended up completely saggy in the butt and hanging around my hip bones. i was in the store today and tried on a pair in 26 regular and those were also too big; i didn\\'t have time to try I bought both color options in this dress and they are both gorgeous but i think this dress must only look good on the model and her body types because i put it on and cringed. i\\'m 5\\'7\" and slim. it was matronly. i also ordered my usual size small and felt like the medium might have been better? the picture of blue colored dress looks more fitted around the waist and these dresses and very loose. the only way it would be flattering is if you added a belt. keep that in mind if you do buy. pretty So bummed. i was really hoping this top would work for me. i got the black in regular size 4 and the pink in petite size 4. both hit my breast too high and were too bulky in the mid section. i have a sort of short torso, wear a small 34c, and am have a defined waist. when tops are bulky, it gives me no shape and just looks terrible. i am having the hardest time finding pretty tops that suit my figure. they did not lie flat like on the model but had so much extra fabric they stuck out.\\nthe constr I needed a white denim pant and this one fits fine. it isn\\'t as slimming as i had hoped for because it isn\\'t a stretchier denim. but, my husband says he likes how they look and they do fit. pants are not easy for me. i have a generous booty and thighs and a small waist. quality is good. My husband never has anything negative to say about my clothes until i wore these pants! they are not flattering and kept stretching out until i could pull them off without unzipping them! baggy in the behind and sloppy looking. they are going back asap! I want to love this shirt, i really do, but it\\'s huge! the top is tent-like, which would be adorable with skinny jeans, however the length of the back dips so low, the top kind of reminds me of pajamas. the color is beautiful, more like a light grey heather, and the white piping is like a shimmery ribbon material. overall, the top is cute, but it dips too low in the back and the bow weighs down the back of the shirt, so it makes it hard to adjust it in the front. sadly, it\\'s a return. I so wanted this skirt to work, love the design! but, it\\'s way, way too long... i am 5, 5, 116lb, and the small is 1 inch on the floor. i step on the skirt as i walk. I bought this shirt in a l, since i didn\\'t want it to be too fitted and was concerned a m would be. it is so boxy! it\\'s like a completely different shirt. i have no idea how it looks good on anyone, unless it is simply widened the larger the size. maybe a m wouldn\\'t be as wide and therefore as boxy, but this shirt is just a bad mess. returning. For those who are wondering this sweater coat is 50% lambswool and 50% acrylic. the original version of this coat was 100% lambswool. 50% acrylic yet the price remained the same???i would have payed more money to have this sweater coat made in 100% lambswool like the original version. this is another example of declining quality and a high price tag for synthetic materials. The fabric is very soft and the fit is formed to the body. low cut, so may want to pair with a cami. great basic for work! Material is kind of thick. stretchy. the orange i ordered was just too bright for me. i\\'m 8/10 and got the 10. i think the 8 would\\'ve worked better. sending back, mostly bc the color didn\\'t look good on me. Very nice fabric and quality but runs very large. i had to return my pair of a size 0. stinks to pay for shipping on a product that looks so different in the picture. I really wanted to love this top, but there is way too much fabric. it looks nothing like the pictures. it was more like a maternity top vs. a swingy top. i\\'ll be returning this one. I really loved the pattern and style of this dress! unfortunately, i had to return it because i have broad shoulders and it is a pretty stiff top that cut into the flabby area near my armpits. for most people it\\'s probably perfect! but if you have wide shoulders or any concerns about the armpit flab, this might not be a great choice for you. I was so excited to wear this shirt, even after reading the review that it curls up i decided to give this shirt a shot, and i found that the same thing happened to me. it also clings tightly to the body. i would not recommend this shirt for anyone with broad shoulders. I love this!!!! nice and lightweight. super stylish I really love this top, great colors, comfortable, long enough (always a problem for me), light but feels quality fabric and nice details. I am not sure who would look good in this dress. it is extremely oversized with tons of fabric that will not flatter anyone! I wanted to love this top, but when i received the picture on the website is a dark charcoal almost black and the \"grey\" that you order is much, much lighter grey. in addition, this shirt is super boxy... thus why the model probably is pinning her elbows to her side to bring the top in. going back disappointed. I love this shirt!!! the front is a little shorter than i thought it would be, but overall, it is so cute and comfy!! wish they had it in more colors!! The reason for the title above is this skirt doesn\\'t wow me. i felt like i could find this anywhere, and i don\\'t go to retailer for such things. they have definitely mainstreamed more and more over the years....\\r\\n__________\\r\\npros:\\r\\n- tts. i tried on a large (and i\\'m normally either a 10 or 12) and it fit well and hung well on my hourglass and wider hips without billowing out.\\r\\n- flows nicely! it does have a great movement to it.\\r\\n- a good everyday skirt.\\r\\n- not sheer at all. it is lined.\\r\\n- when y Pros: pretty, nicely made.\\r\\n\\r\\ncons: the fabric is stiffer than i was expecting, and the blouse cuts in under the arms. (i don\\'t mean that it is tight or digs in, but it cuts in; you can\\'t tell in the angle of the photo.) the blouse is short as well, and, as i am curvy, it really stuck out all around at the waist. worth trying on if you have a straighter figure. Love this kimono! it is so versatile. it is a one size only so it might be .a bit volumnous for some people. This is a pretty dress, but it runs at least one size too large. the silk is of good quality. it would be good for somebody who is slim and tall. I was disappointed when i got this romper in the mail. the picture looks much cuter than in person. although it\\'s true to size, it looks pretty baggy on. also, i thought the grey (top) and blue (bottom) were too similarly colored; more contrast would have been nice. i\\'m returning this item. I am usually a medium/large and was pleased to fit in the small/medium that i ordered after reading some of the reviews. lovely piece, great to wear over a short sleeve t-shirt, 3/4 of a sleeve shirt or even a long sleeve shirt when weather permits here in florida. very happy i ordered this!! I love and live in these but the recent scoop tanks i purchased were thin, not as great. so i want to recommend them because they are really versatile but the quality has deminished. Color is pretty true to pic, a bright blue red.  sleeves have more volume than pic.  so does the body.  in my opinion.  maybe if i looked like the model.  i wear a 27 in jeans and it doesn\\'t look so cute on me.  also i\\'m a brunette.  angles?  pinning?  i have to wonder.  probably just pics at good angles.  it looks really cute on the model though. I have other pairs of stevie jeans and looked forward to receiving these.i would say that they run about a size large compared to my other pairs. i am 5\\'2\" and ordered a petite, but i found the length to be about 2-3 inches too long. as compared to how they look on the model. also, the rise is relatively low. otherwise, the quality is great, and the denim is very soft. i will probably return these given that i am not wowed. The product looked more or less as expected, but the fabric felt very cheap. not the quality i would expect from retailer. the shirt is also very short, which did not bother me but is something others should be aware of. If you look closely at the pattern it is a giant triangle running across the front of your body. this doesn\\'t do great things really if you have more of an hourglass shape or small waist. it completely removed the idea that you have a small waist and draws attention to the area of the triangle that is the largest. also, i agree with another reviewer about being cautious about buttons, as several were off some of the dresses. Beautiful color and the fabric is very substantial and soft. but, they didn\\'t finish the bottom hem! the dress is lined and the bottom inside has a ribbon sewn in as a type of hem, but the actual edge is just cut and not turned in on itself. because of this the whole bottom had a hundred little fabric frays. the rest of the dress is so polished it just doesn\\'t make sense. also, while the fabric is beautiful my dress had a weird mark on the chest, almost like a water mark. just overall bad attent My preference is clothing made of natural fibers, but i couldn\\'t resist trying this on once i felt it! the cut-out pattern in the fabric, the color,  the buttons & the design of the back all add to make a dress i\\'m going to wear with leather flip-flops during the day or wedges & a denim jacket at night. it\\'s perfect for southern california fall (& likely much of winter this year) weather. i\\'m a 32d (& won\\'t need/wear a bra) & although i usually wear a 6, i bought a 4. maeve, i like your style! I love this dress because it is amazingly feminine and easy to wear. i put this dress on and immediately felt elegant, sophisticated, and flirty all at the same time. a few tailoring uniquenesses i want to mention; stretchy, form fitting, sexy sheer upper and front back panel, you can wear a bra and not see it thru the sheer front and back portions of the dress, the waist is exactly tailored to show off back side. it is true to size. Love the detail and the way it hangs. i sometimes struggle with blousy tops because i have a larger chest, but this one didn\\'t make me look pregnant! i purchased this with the 30% off... i wouldn\\'t have paid full price for it. The dress is pretty, i ordered a 4 and 6 not knowing how it ran, i took both back the neck is too tight! I noted that this runs large- i should say it runs wide. it is supposed to be flowy like in the picture, but i am really swimming in the l. that being said, i worry that if i returned for a m that it would be too short in the front. i am 5\\'10 for reference, and i would say the length in front is a little shorter than i would like, but it still works. the black and white print is beautiful- i paired it today with dark skinny jeans and received compliments. other reviews about the batwing sleeves I love this dress. i usually get an xs but it runs a little snug in bust so i ordered up a size. very flattering and feminine with the usual retailer flair for style. This is so thin and poor quality. especially for the price. it felt like a thin pajama top. the buttons are terrible little shell buttons. this could not have been returned faster. I purchased this top in the white and love the contrast between the stripes and floral pattern around the neckline. it fit perfectly, however i\\'m concerned that it might shrink because then it would be too short. i am 5\\'3\" tall, 120 lbs. and small busted. it draped really nicely. small would give me a little more length but may be too loose. I love this. it is perfect. it is sheer, but i wear a black cami underneath and it looks great. so glad antro finally has something with a waist! the small metal buttons are a really nice added detail. i wish you would make more tops with a defined waist like this one! I loved almost everything about this skirt. thick and lined and love the buttons. comfortable. the only problem was that the two sides flared out at the bottom, presumably from the buttons. i was torn, but in the end it just looked too silly and it was sent back. Ok so this top is as cute in person as it is online. runs very small as theres no stretch or give in fabric. i normally wear 12 and i couldnt even halfway get this on lol. i may consider a 14-16 but the stores didnt have this yet to try on. the ladies at the counter were crushing on this top though!\\nif you can find your fit this top is great for layering! I have been wanting this skirt for a long time. i was worried about waist which is fitted. i finally ordered it and it i very cute. the waist is indeed fitted but there is some give to the fabric, fabric is soft cotton not unlike denim with some stretch. there i a soft cotton liner in skirt. i took the cloth belt off because i cannot retie it so neatly as in the photo, also i just don\\'t want a bow on my stomach. i own a cute narrow belt that i will wear with skirt as i think something is needed This is a very light, flowy dress. the lining is very fitted, but the dress is actually not fitted. it has a nice flow, but hits right at the thigh area before flowing out. plan to wear it to work.the color is very bright and pretty. I have to agree with the first reviewer! i really loved the color of this dress and could almost have overlooked the lack of a lining, but when i felt the fabric expecting a nice lush silk, instead getting what felt like a polyster instead i couldn\\'t justify it for the price. i really liked the fact that a maxi came in petite sizes as well, but just couldn\\'t get over the poor quality for that price so back it goes! \\r\\n\\r\\ni hope the team members or buyers at retailer are reading these reviews I love the coh fleetwood jeans, and since i was looking for a pair of not-so-skinny skinny jeans, i thought these would be great. but unlike the fleetwoods, which are a substantial weight denim, these are very soft -- too soft -- and bag out in the first 5 minutes. the style is okay but the fabric makes them unflattering. maybe if you\\'re looking for jeans you can lounge in, these will be for you because they do have the comfort equivalent of sweats. I saw this shirt on a friend and had to buy it right away! it has the comfort of a regular tee but the frills at the bottom give it that retailer look! true to size. The cut is small. i am 5\\'9\", 150 lbs and usually wear 6-8/medium pants. medium in these is too fitted on my hips and rear.the polyester will be hot in summer. returning for another brand. I love this shirt for a throw on and go.  hangs nicely and fits great.  colors are more vibrant in person.  i love mauve, i think they do a great job with their designs! Beautiful jacket and i got lots of compliments. true to size. it\\'s not thick but it\\'s very warm. Love this blouse, however upon every time i wear it, a new button pops off. i have had to replace every button! This sweater is gorgeous! the color is a true periwinkle which really attracted me to it. the bell sleeves are a nice change. i have very long arms and they fit perfectly. i could wear this sweater out. So disappointing! everything i\\'ve owned from bordeaux has washed well and stood the test of time. one wash and this was ruined! shrunk terrible even after washing in cold water on delicate and laying flat to dry. completely ruined. returned it. Love the colors in this top. it\\'s a shame it was so big and baggy i\\'m not that big a person but really made me look big and frumpy . i am 5\\'6\", 130#. athlete. size small was way too much material for my frame This is an awesome piece and i got many complements while wearing it! it is that rare combo of super comfortable yet amazing look all in one. it does run a bit big, especially on top but the stride is short so i had to keep my regular size or i would have had a wedgie all night. I was surprised by the other reviews. expected to live in this all winter but found the style bulky and awkward. the hi-low cut with so much bulk just wasn\\'t flattering. i wish the armholes had been larger so that the body of the shirt would have fallen closer to my body. the armholes are the size of a fitted shirt which pulls the shirt wide rather than allowing it to drape a bit more. it is incredibly soft but just not as comfortable as i\\'d hoped. it went back. I\\'m on the fence about this one. it is pretty Not a pretty blouse - it\\'s quite utilitarian in design - and it runs enormous. I was really hoping to like this, but it did not look the way it does on the model, at least not on me. the sharkbite hem is much more pronounced and looser. the one in the photo looks like it was pinned back. i am 5\\'8\" and usually wear a medium or large. i got a medium and there was a lot more material on the bottom half than the photo shows. it made me look bigger and was not flattering. material has a nice weave but it\\'s thin and delicate. i bought the (holly) deep olive and the blue. colors This dress is so cute! i went to the store to try it on and although i knew the dress would fit i could not get the zipper up. my mom, the sales lady and i all tried to get the zipper up and it would not move past the ribbon. i wish i could have bought this dress but i can\\'t without a working zipper. i tried a size up and every dress at the store that was my size and none of them worked. please fix the zipper problem so i can have this dress! I think the model is wearing a larger size, per the first review. i am 5\\'2\" and 105 lbs and the xs fits about the same in length but not nearly voluminous. so you should order up if that is what you want. this will be perfect for some long summer flights instead of a wrap, since the sleeves will be more convenient and i always look schlumpy rather than elegant in a shawl! if it had some cashmere or another softer fiber i would be totally in love with it. As the other reviewer said, this top is pretty short. nice design but i wish it was a little longer, and i am short... i tried on xxs regular, xs petite and xs regular.\\r\\n\\r\\nxxs was closest to flattering around the top part (shoulders, cehst), but stil la bit short. the petite was jsut too short and xs regular, a bit longer, but a little loose... os hte fit jsut ddind\\'t work. i may wait for sale on this, but probably something beter wil lcome along.\\r\\n\\r\\ngreat for those who want to show their assets The design is beautiful but it was thick and too warm for a summer event i was planning on wearing it to.\\r\\nalso, the seam below the chest was uncomfortable.\\r\\nneeded to return First problem-i would not have ordered this at all had the description been correct. the fabric description is cotton which the dress is most certainly not. secondly, it has a really funky, cheap, unfinished, raw-hemmed slip which is simply not fitting for the dress. the keyhole in the front is super long-again, does not seem to fit the dress. i am not happy with this piece at all but it did fit tts. length is just above knee. i am 5\\'5\" 142 lbs 34d and the six was a good fit. sending this home t I just adore this top! it is so comfy and stylish. i wear it with a little purple cardigan and feel like an iris in bloom. like other reviewers have mentioned though, the straps are way too long. i had to cut them down and re-sew to make it wearable. before that it just slouched in front and looked sloppy and awful. i tried layering under it, which looked absurd. I tried this on at the store in black. the lace on the back is gorgeous and the fabric is very soft, but i would disagree with the previous reviews - i don\\'t think this is flattering on all body types. i\\'ve got an hourglass figure and the top absolutely robs you of a waist. it drapes straight down on the front, so if you have a larger chest, you end up looking like a football player.\\n\\ni think for a narrow frame or a smaller chest, this would be very flattering. Tried on standard xs and the photo on-line is slightly misleading as i thought that there were more colors involved in the embroidery pattern. in person, the pattern is not as intricate with only 2 solid colors. the body of the shirt is light, airy/billowy, not as form grazing like on the model..which i don\\'t mind. i still love the top but would have to go for a petite xs or even a petite xxs so that it would be a little more fitted all around. note that the embroidery on the dã©colletã© feels lik This dress fits well and the material allows for hiding lumps and bumps. material is heavy, yet soft. i could see wearing it with sneakers as the model is, or dressing it up with jewelry and heels. this will be a perfect dress to take on vacation, as it won\\'t get wrinkled and it is so versatile. i\\'m normally a size 4-8 depending on clothing item, and i bought this in a size small. fits perfect. for reference, i am 38-26-38. Love love love this jumpsuit! normally i stay away from jumpsuits because i hate to have to completely undress to use the bathroom, but this was too cute to pass up. fits great, extremely flattering to my athletic build, super comfy. it sort of looks like a maxi-dress due to the wide legs. length was perfect. i am 5\\'3\" and did not have to hem it. On the picture shows the belt.doesn\\'t come with the belt. It is the perfect shirt that looks and feels great. i wear a size 4 and it fits perfectly. So i really loved this dress. i am tall (6ft) and the size 8 was perfect length. i would have worn it with flat dressy sandals. i would say it is true to size. i am not a flowy dress kind of girl but this was just the perfect amount of \"flow\" without making me feel like i was wearing a long potato sack. the back is just gorgeous and unique. here is why i couldn\\'t make it mine. the tube top part is completely detachable and extremely thin. there is literally not much to it and i\\'m not sure it wou Cute design for a casual top. however it was a little snug on the bust for a medium. i returned it I didn\\'t realize how much i would love this. wore it to work the other day and got more compliments than i have in a very long time on an outfit! it\\'s comfortable and easy and flattering. bought this totally on a whim and so glad i did! Overall nice material and styling but be prepare for it to be huge. i purposely sized down and i still felt like i was swimming in this. This dress is amazing and spans multiple uses. i brought it to st. john with me and used it as an after swim dress as well as a going out on the town dress. it is flattering and a light but durable material. the only thing that was even remotely challenging was that i needed to adjust my bra straps to be hidden. overall i loved the dress and totally recommend it. There is no possible bra to wear with this top. after one washing the neck felt funky. the pink color is very light. it\\'s long enough for leggings. my shirt is a high hemline on one side than the other. i\\'ll wear it but wish the neck wasn\\'t so funky. I purchased this sweater in my usual xs, but found the silhouette to be way more tent-like than pictured on the model. the knit is pretty stiff, too, so the sweater didn\\'t lay flat but hung on me in kind of a triangle shape. also, the sweater knit was heavier than i expected from the picture and seemed to be more of a fall weight piece. i am fairly small, but lately i\\'m finding that retailer pieces are huge in an xs and i have to size down to xxs. i know i\\'m not that tiny ... maybe this wou I snapped this up under the 20% off top sale and free shipping because it looks so pretty. i ordered a large because i usually take a large or xl in tops. it is huge! i could have taken a medium if not for the lining -- which is tiny! the lining does not cover the chest and bra area and hits the belly button area while the orange part falls down to the hips. and it looks like a block and makes me look wide. who needs that? like i said, a medium would fit better and would not be so wide, but i fe This is an extremely flattering dress. i couldn\\'t resist buying it, even though i didn\\'t come into the store looking for a dressier dress, which i feel this is. once i tried it on, i had to purchase it. its one of those things that i know i won\\'t regret because at some point, an occasion will show up that i\\'ll wear it to. its soft, comfy and flowing and accentuates the body\\'s curves without being too tight or clingy. its a classic! It\\'s a beautiful skirt. the color is vivid and the skirt is flattering. This blazer looks great on the model and i have a long torso so i thought it would be perfect. when i got it it looked like a big box and didn\\'t fit anywhere. the shoulder pads were giant and the bottom of the coat was huge. i got a small based on other reviews, but it was way too big. sadly, i had to return it. This vest is very nice and fashionable, very stylish. i like it a lot. however, it is too itchy. the opening in the front didn\\'t allow me to close as many buttons as i like but i would totally wear this stylish vest even though it is not as functional when it is cold. however, the itchiness is too much. i don\\'t wear wool unless it is ultra soft or mixed with cashmere, so i could not imaging wearing this vest, it is too itchy. why ruin such a good thing? This sweater/tunic is very poor quality - the seams looked like they were about to come apart as soon as i got it. and, without a chunky statement necklace, it looks like your grandmothers apron. there just isn\\'t any style to it - has to go back. The fit on this jean is amazing, they just run large, and then they also stretch quite a bit after 1-2 wears. i am usually a solid size 30 (and have other pairs of dl1961s) but i am buying in a 28 - so i would say one or two sizes down from your usual size. I tried this on at my local retailer store in the white. the fabric is pretty with metallic threads of silver running through the white. the white is see-through but that didn\\'t bother me as i would wear it as a beach cover-up. i would say it runs large. i am usually a size small (4-6) and the xs was quite roomy on me (and i\\'m 5\\' 9\" tall), 32d chest. i liked it, it was comfortable, but i just couldn\\'t decide if i looked a bit frumpy in it. maybe it was just too big all over. in the end, i d I ordered the taupe version of this tee, which was a medium brown with black stripes. the fabric felt itchy and rough, and was pretty sheer for not being light colored. i didn\\'t care for the fit, which was extremely boxy and wide; from the picture, i expected an a-line fit, but not a wide drop with webbed underarms. i ordered 2 sizes, and could have worn the smaller if i\\'d kept this tee. it runs on the larger side. what astounded me most was that both tees i ordered were sewn with completely cro I followed the advice of other reviewers and sized down from a s to xs. i was worried about the length of the torso since i\\'m long in that area, but the xs still worked great. it\\'s a totally adorable jumpsuit with a nice fit. my biggest peeve with this was that it came dirty on the hems...like it had been dragged on the ground somewhere. unfortunately, there were no more xs online once i got it though, so i will keep and try to clean. this is not the first time in recent months that i have recei Absolutely love these pants! i have had these pilcos for about two months now and it has been a staple in my fall wardrobe. i have worn them at least once a week. the only downfall is the button has already fallen off and the seam in the knee has recently torn apart. given the leather, i\\'m not sure if they can be fixed. these are fabulous, but the quality is just not there. very disappointing. This item is huge. i\\'m normally a medium, sized down to a small, still massive. couldn\\'t go too much smaller because the buttons would pull at the chest. but the sleeves are very wide, as is the waist. way too much fabric. i had high hopes for this one but it just doesn\\'t work. for reference i love billowy and flowy tops, but this was a tent. I knew going in that it may not fit a d cup but the fabric is beautiful so i thought i\\'d give it a try. i wear a 36d and bought a large. it\\'s got a clasp in the back so there\\'s no adjustment on how it fits around which for me was too big. the triangles did not provide enough coverage, left too much side boob. the fabric was very pretty in person but thinner than i expected which also made it seem less sturdy. sadly, have to return and cancel the back-ordered bottoms. i would recommend to someone I wanted to really love this because it\\'s a bit more styled than a plain tank, but the front and back both poof out and i felt like i was wearing a maternity top. just didn\\'t do my body any justice....loved the top and that part fit great, but the bottom part was too poofy and sadly not a good look at all on me. Designs are nice and texture feels comfortable, but sleeves are odd because they are angled.\\r\\ni wonder what i should do to look cool in this t-shirt.\\r\\ni tried wearing neutral motif, but i still felt odd.\\r\\nalso, width is relatively wide, so it runs large.\\r\\ni rated average for overall rating because of these odd sleeves and feelings.\\r\\npersonally, i do not recommend this t-shirt, but who knows, it may be right for you...\\r\\nso, my advice is to try wearing it in a fitting room and check whether it loo Even though i had to return this top because it did not fit me properly, it\\'s a very nicely made and attractive piece with a lot of versatility. This skirt looked absolutely beautiful in store and took my breath away. i immediately headed to the fitting room to try it on, but was disappointed by the awkward ruching. if this skirt has removed that upper portion and kept a normal waistband (thereby also shortening it to knee length), it would have been lovely. it should be noted that this is midi-length, which is awkward on me. i was unable to find a cute way to wear this which is disappointing since it could have been lovely. Online, this looks like a great sweater. i ordered an xxsp and found that this sweater is much wider in the middle than pictured. in fact, i\\'m pretty sure they pinned the shirt in the back for the picture to make it appear slimmer. unfortunately, this sweater will not work for me, as i am an hourglass shape and this shirt makes me look 20 pounds heavier. I loved this skirt when i tried it on. the material is soft with a bit of stretch. i\\'d say this runs a little large. for reference, i\\'m usually a size 2/4 in retailer and the 2 was still a little large towards the end of the day as it stretched out. \\r\\n\\r\\nhowever, my disappointment was with the buttons.i wore it for a day when all of a sudden the top button popped off. fine, that button is the most used. i sewed it back on myself and even reinforced the top three buttons that i use to take on and of I really like the red version of this shirt. it will add a pop of color under a blazer for work or it can be easily accessorized with a necklace, for the weekend. i am 137 lbs, a 34d chest and the small fit me perfectly. Loved the design and quality of this suit but the cups seemed huge. i weight 135lbs 5\\'6\" and wear a 34c. i bought a large in this suit because other reviews said it ran small (normally i wear a size medium) i did like how it fit everywhere expect the chest. i\\'m wondering if the medium will still be too large in the chest and hoping the rest would still fit okay. not sure i want to go through the hassle to exchange and it not fit again! it\\'s so cute otherwise and would be perfect if you have a la This fell apart after wearing it once. for the price, it should hold up better. it\\'s too delicate. I ordered this dress in two sizes, pxs and ps. they both arrived in a timely manner but the pxs was snagged upon arrival. there were a few other reviewers that stated the dress snagged easily but i loved the classic look of this dress so i thought i would take the chance. unfortunately i had to take both back to the store because the potential for snagging the fabric was too high even considering the sale price. also, the dress comes with a cotton slip but the slip for the pxs was tiny while the I am hippie and always worry about coverage. this was a nice fit, good coverage but did not look old-ladyish. Loved the dress. loved the pattern and the cut. unfortunately it did not work for me. it is cut too low under the arm pits and therefore, showed too much breast. it is not made to wear a bra with either so that is not a solution. sticky boobs will not work either because it is the \"side breast\" that shows. i hated to have to send back but.....still looking for something similar and great! Thought i would try this as other reviewers loved it and it\\'s out of my comfort zone. it looked like a poncho with a baggy tank underneath. not worth the price. the tassels looked a bit worn as well. I got this tank because it was on sale, thinking it could be cute, but i didn\\'t have high hopes. once i put it on, i loved it. i have a long torso and it\\'s the perfect length. i have worn it with a jacket over it also to extend its life into cooler weather. This is my favorite dress i\\'ve bought in the past year! it is super flattering and can be worn for work or casual wear. the fabric is soft and comfortable. can\\'t wait till the weather gets warmer so i can start wearing it regularly!\\n\\ni\\'m 5\\'5 145lbs, 37-29-39. i got the medium petite and it fits perfectly! I truly cannot understand the great reviews on this dress!  i purchased in both a sp and a mp.  i am 5\\'2\" 120#.  the mp fit perfectly.  i definitely wouldn\\'t keep it though because it looks like someone sewed a bunch of old sweatshirts together.  it\\'s not super soft, coarse on the inside, and feels old.  the back is longer than the front, it just looks like something my daughter would make in sewing class out of scraps.  even with leggings and great boots, it looks worn. As the other reviewers stated, it does run large, i sized down 1 size and it\\'s perfect. great dress to wear so many ways. I bought this jacket recently and i actually had been watching it in my retailer. store, but, they didn&#39;t have my size.  someone must have returned a size small and i scooped it up.  i probably would have bought the xs but, it was gone.  i went with it a little oversized and love it!  great quality and workmanship on the embroidery.   more like the items that retailer used to sell in 2004 and 2005!  super cute, love it! I have been continually disappointed in retailer\\'s clothing for the past year. i feel like their prices have soared and the quality has remained so-so, but dresses like these somehow make the cut. it does not make sense. since when did retailer exclusively market to older women? no, retailer\\'s market has always been young adults. this dress is extremely matronly. although the bottom print is nice, the hot pink belt?? is completely mismatched and gaudy. i really hope retailer starts curating better dress This dress looks nothing like the photo. the sequins are dull, no sheen at all. the faux leather panels and straps look and feel like cheap, shiny plastic. i didn\\'t even try it on, because it was so hideous, when i pulled it out of the box. not remotely worth the price and wouldn\\'t buy it on sale for $20 either. skip. Size down on this top. bought it online and when i took out of the packagei quickly put it back in. you could have put 4 of me in the xs. i think even an xxs would be huge. extremely boxy!! i recommend it only if you can find the correct size. Cute and comfy! i usually wear a small but bought a medium because it appeared to run a little small. These pants fit wonderfully. perfect for casual day i had planned at a music festival when it was still a little chilly out. they fit just like my skinny ag jeans, but have a more relaxed feel in that they uber skinny. held up well all day. I initially saw this top a few months ago, and fell in love. it ended up selling out in stores, so i ordered it online, where it was back-ordered by a couple of months. i received it this past week, and was sadly disappointed. the design is pretty, but overall the quality is sorely lacking. i wonder if maybe the first batch was good, but when they realized they were so popular, and had more made, the newer batches weren\\'t as good? not sure. the one i got had inconsistent red embroidery, and ther I\\'m very happy with this sweater--it\\'s very soft to the touch and comfortable to wear. i have the pink version and find the shimmer on the waist and arms to be a nice touch. the only concern i have for this is that it feels like it stretches out a bit easily. by the end of the day the arms feel a bit baggy. I have been looking for a nice, white tunic and i should have known when i saw this was one size fits all. maybe because i am petite (5\\'2\") but there was so much material hanging everywhere that it made me look even shorter and fat. who wants that? so sending it back. I really liked the design. ordered a medium which was huge. also thought i would not be able to tolerate it because of the material -- a bit itchy. returned it. This tunic dress is an easy \"go to\" outfit. it looks put together immediately. it is soft and comfortable. i ordered the regular xs even though typically i prefer petite sizing. this dress is above my knees in the front. i am 5\\'4\" and weight about 118#. i would have ordered a petite size but had previously tried this on in the store and knew the regular sizing was a good fit for me. in the store i tried the taupe color which seemed a bit see through. i ordered the green and it is a lovely shade. This top looks great on the model -- a petite frame, small-busted body.  i am 5\\'2\" and have a large bust and curvy hips. this top hit in all the wrong places. the front looks very cropped and frumpy, if you have a large bust. the width of the top of very boxy.  the top is very soft and comfortable and the color is pretty. Well first off i knew a jumpsuit was going to be a gamble for me- i have a long torso at 6 feet , but i just loved the print and the style and typically all things sactuary so i was willing to risk it.\\nsadly the torso length was an issue and it seemed to run small to me-i ordered a small which usually would fit fine, but ended up pulling across my hips and with the patten being what it is... well on me it just wasn\\'t flattering or comfortable. This dress is very good quality, with beautiful beading on the bodice. it\\'s a heavier material than i was expecting, but that was a pleasant surprise. unfortunately, when i put it on and looked in the mirror, i laughed out loud because i looked like a fancy swiss milkmaid. the shoulders are puffier than shown on the model and, combined with the overall design and length, i couldn\\'t think of anywhere to wear it. this is an easy return for me. the dress runs very true to size and the bodice is fit Great color and shape for all seasons. i was so elated to get this piece on sale! love it! I saw this online but it never struck me as something i would wear. however, after seeing it in the store it really caught my eye with its detailing, so i tried it on. what a great decision because it is so much more beautiful in person, and very soft and warm. it\\'s a perfect winter sweater to start the new year. i am 5\\'-7\", 138 lbs. and the medium fit perfectly, though it\\'s a little shorter on me than shown in the photos. Intrepid soul that i am, i washed it in the machine in cold water on a 25 minute cycle, then put it in the dryer for 8 minutes, shook it out, hung it up, and it is just the same as when it went in. doesn\\'t need to be ironed and didn\\'t shrink. yes, the swing is vast, but that is part of its charm. pair it with a fitted piece on the bottom and no one will think that you are actually needing that much material to cover anything! i think it is fun, something i will use for years, wonderfully comfort This is so thin and poor quality. especially for the price. it felt like a thin pajama top. the buttons are terrible little shell buttons. this could not have been returned faster. I ordered this top in white along with the meadow rue lace sleeve top. while they are the same price, they aren\\'t even close in quality. this top is one of the sheerest tops that i have seen. the trim, pocket and the lace-up tie are made from sheer type material that was twisted and didn\\'t lay right, and the tag sewn inside, was sewn with red thread and showed through, very visible. i don\\' t think it would hold up after many washes. i returned this one and ordered another color in the lace sleev This romper was so cute and with the great reviews i thought i needed to try it...but once trying it on i realized it was an odd fit, there is not enough fabric to make it look as relaxed as it does on the model. also, the sleeves were a bit wider than they look in the picture. would probably work well for someone with a petite figure. I was expecting a nice golden yellow color but what i received was very dull in color with greenish undertones. very disappointed. will be returning. This is a beautiful dress! the color is really great and i love the cut - flattering around the neckline and loose and flowy. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe one downside is that it is pretty long. i am 5\\'6\" and usually somewhere between and xs and s for dresses, so went with the xs. the size is great but it\\'s just a tad long for wearing with flats. i actually think if i was bustier the length would be fine, but since i\\'m pretty flat there\\'s nothing to fill the dress! i wish i had been able to snag a petite, but they w I loved the look of this sweater, but the workmanship was surprisingly poor. there were missed stitches, and loose threads throughout, and even a tag sewn to the outside. retailer was great about the return. i really wanted to keep it and was very disappointed. Oh how i love moth sweaters but wow was this one a disappointment. the color is wonderful, the shape is unique and the stitch work is lovely but that\\'s where the compliments end. it\\'s an itchy, cheap feeling acrylic that is too short for my torso. i am truly disappointed that at this price point it was such a cheap feeling piece. so bummed. so so bummed. This is a cute dress but the fabric is very heavy and i didn\\'t find it to drape well on me. it is a very heavy felted poly type of fabric. i ordered it for a specific event coming up this summer and the fabric will not work for warm temps. the style and design of the dress is great though. for reference it did fit fairly true to size. i wear a 0 or 2. the xs fit well. if the fabric works for your situation then i would try this dress. I ordered this vest in xxs, since i am usually an xs and was looking for a bit of a tighter fit on such a loose vest. even then, the vest looked like a large. not only was it incredibly loose - much looser than in looks in the picture - but the arm holes were huge too. it just looked too big, not artfully drapey. This sweater is very pretty. i had my concerns being that i don\\'t normally pay $300.00 for a sweater but i found the material to be extremely high quality and the details really make it a beautiful piece. i literally got a little tired of people telling me all day how pretty it was. this is definitely a piece of clothing i will cherish for years to come. This dress is tricky. the fabric is very thin and the under slip it comes with runs small. i wear it with my yoga shorts underneath. the fabric is a very thin linen. my husband loves me in this dress so that a huge pro. its very light and cool perfect for the summer time. I ordered this in both an extra small and a small... i found that there was a very big difference in the two sizes- the extra small was true to size and had a great width, but was shorter in length than i would\\'ve liked (if it shrunk at all, it would\\'ve been unwearable). the small was quite a jump in size and was a little wider than i liked, but i decided to keep that one. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe top was very cute and comfortable when i wore it, however i just washed it once on delicate in cold water and when i I bought this cardigan to take on a trip to the middle east. it turned out to be a great purchase. the weight of the sweater is substantial enough to add warmth and not just style. i am not a huge fan of light-weight sweaters as i tend to be chilly all the time. i was concerned that the design of the back might accentuate my rounder backside, however it drapes very nicely. i am petite 5\\'1\" with moderate curves. i typically get the xxsp and this was perfect. the neutral color is great with almost I completely agree with the other reviewers this top is easy to throw on with jeans or trousers and so comfy! i\\'m 5\\'3 with a 34ddd chest and i ordered in my normal medium which looks fantastic. and if i wanted to i think i could have sized down for a more form flattering look but i love the ease of this top. I bought this in size xl and it initially fit me similarly to the model. but, once i washed it (in cold in my machine, reshaped and air-dried), it was so much smaller/shorter. i loved the embroidery on the top. the mix of pattern colors is great too. i like when blues and blacks are mixed together. i don\\'t know how i could have prevented the shrinking. i now throw on a shrug or jacket over to hide the shorter length. still stylish and fun. This looked fabulous on the model, of course, and i love sweater dresses. but even in an xs, i was drowning in fabric and looked ludicrous. concept is good but execution went terribly wrong somewhere. a definite return. I like this shirt, want to love it. i am keeping this shirt hoping to have better arms by summer when i can where this top with black shorts. this shirt does cling, it\\'s a draping sort of fabric; i love how it drapes in the front. only because i am not happy with my arms do i where a cardi with it. also, the underarm area is rather open so i\\'ll wear a bandeau when i wear this without a cardi. The dress is beautiful in pictures, but all the reviews are dead on...it was full of snags when it arrived! 8 snags to be exact. and the fabric was heavier than i expected. sadly, had to return. Really liked the color but the style was too cropped and boxy for me. this sweater was short, wide and unflattering. however, i like this designer so i ordered another style with a different silhouette. I love the feel and drape of silk. this dress has lovely drape, and fantastic color. i think if paired with the right sweater and leggings, this will work well into the fall, and also transition into other seasons if you are savvy! the only awkward point about this dress is that you must wear a belt with it if you have an hourglass shape, otherwise it\\'s a beautiful swing fit. Great sweater but it was just a little too short on me so it is going back. it is extremely fuzzy and soft though. I like the look and fit of this shirt. can be dressed up or more casual. i got the purple motif, although i also like the brown and think that with all of the black in there (on the brown one) it would give a dressier look. i usually wear small from retailer, although this is my first blouse from this brand -- ended up getting an xs regular. i wanted the sleeves to fit at 3/4 as shown in the pics, but still be loose. i had a ton of extra room in the small, and the sleeves hit at wrist bone I ordered the green, black and ivory because i thought they were so cute. the sweater is short but still cute. the ivory one i will return though. it has sparkle that\\'s not noticeable in the online picture plus when it arrived it had a huge snag in the fabric. i\\'m actually quite surprised they sent it to me in such poor condition. I really wanted to love this tank top.  it has vibrant colors and a unique pattern; however, i should have listened to the reviews.  there was way too much fabric!  it made me look pregnant!  the tank top is going to be returned. I was hoping these would be like some of the lace shorts i bought from retailer last year that i loved so much. sadly, no. first of all they run small. i am between a s and xs in most brands, bought a s in these because i like my shorts on the looser side. these felt a little snug and short, but i decided to keep them. the first time i washed them, they were ruined. i followed the directions exactly and even put them in a lingerie bag in the washer, plus a delicate cycle, no dryer. the lace is man Beautiful top! the body flows nicely and the colors are wonderfully vivid. it goes with everything and looks great for work or going out. my only gripe is the sleeves are really tight. i struggle a little to get on and off but once on it looks awesome. This looks cute in the web photo, unfortunately it is absolutely huge in person. i got the small and have to return it because it is not wearable for me. I had hoped this blouse would be white - but it is cream in color. it was also more boxy than i thought it would be. i am usually a 4 or a 6 and went with the 6. a size 4 would be a better fit. I got this sweater with high hopes to wear it with some leggings for christmas. it looked adorable (and long!) on the model. however, it doesn\\'t even cover my butt, that\\'s how short it is. if you\\'re anything over 5\\'4\", i\\'d say it\\'ll be too short for leggings. Possibly my favorite retailer purchase ever! like wearing a cloud & fit perfectly! if you\\'re busty - not sure about it -- but otherwise wow! told my husband: hope you like it because you\\'ll be seeing it all the time & he not only agreed but wanted to know if they made pajamas for men. This was a cute design, but didn\\'t work for me. the fabric was slightly see-through, and too tight around the bust. Very nicely made with attention to detail. thick and comfy. hand washing recommended. that\\'s the only negative. I tried this dress on in the store. i loved the fabric and color, but the fit was huge, no matter how much i sized down. there are full dresses and tunics that are supposed to be loose, but this was shapeless in an unflattering way. i was attracted to the style and color, but the execution left much to be desired. This light blouse is beautiful and true to size. i ordered the black one and love it!\\r\\ni would recommend this product I cannot imagine this dress working in any size. i am a small, thin and average height woman (usually a 25/26 in pants, a size 32c bust, and 5\\'6\" tall). this dress was huge. i sized down to a 2 ( i am always a 4 in dresses) and this dress was still big... i do not know if i could size down to a 0 though as the shoulders seemed to fit right. it was ginormous. i got it for a wedding in two months and i will be 3 months pregnant, it still wouldn\\'t work unless i was 9 months pregnant and carrying tr Like another reviewer, i really wanted to love this dress. everything about this screamed perfection: the length, the cut, the stripes, but the fit was really off for me. i\\'m 5\"10\" and am usually between a size 8 and 10. i tried the 8 and the body fit well but the chest and straps were entirely too large (i\\'m a 34d). so i tried the size 6 and chest and straps fit but the body pulled at the buttons. normally, i\\'m all for tailoring to fit, but chest would have needed to be reconstructed which isn\\' There\\'s just the right amount of billowy grace in this dress. the fit is perfect and the material moves and breathes with you. cute with a jean jacket on chillier days too. This is a cute, casual romper but i\\'m on the fence about keeping it. i hate when there is a pattern mismatch - especially across the butt and that\\'s why i\\'m on the fence. i bought my usual xs/0, (5\\'7\", 115lbs, 32b). i would say that it is a little roomy around the bust - if i keep it i might have to have it altered slightly to stop my bra from showing. this is the first jumpsuit that i have tried that actually accommodates my longer torso - so many seem to ride up and that is not flattering!\\r\\nwi I was looking forward to receiving this dress. i am tired of all of the swing dresses - most of which are not flattering on my petite frame. i am also uncomfortable with dresses that fall much above the knee as i am somewhat older. the colors and fabric of this dress are beautiful. vibrant, but not too bright. when i got it on i was thrilled with the fit - until i looked at the back. there are pleats at the waist in back and there is way too much fabric. it looked like i had a bustle under the d Soft fabric. great color for fall and sophisticated detail at waist, sleeves. a keeper! Right out of the bag, this top didn\\'t really match the one pictured here (it is the right top, though). the fabric was heavy and felt \"damp\" -- the way something feels coming out of the wash. very odd.\\r\\nand the fit is nothing like what\\'s shown on the model. the \"v\" is not fitted or nicely wrapped (or even tacked in place) -- it was just two loose, droopy pieces so most of my bra was showing no matter how many times i put the pieces back where they belonged (i\\'m neither \"flat chested\" nor \"busty\" I had hopes for this shirt but was disappointed in the fabric...it\\'s very stiff and heavy for a summer blouse. will be returning it. I ordered this on a whim, not sure what to expect. i\\'m petite (5\\'1, 110) and ordered a small petite. i usually wear xs-s in anthto tops but wanted a little extra room for layering in the cooler months ahead do i opted for the small petite instead of xs. it fits beautifully and is very cozy too. the collar is gorgeous and very soft. i think this is a beautiful and unique piece for any fall wardrobe. Unfortunately this one is going back. the fit is very flattering and the underlying layer is very revealing in the back. I ordered the red/orange but it was much brighter than i expected (felt almost neon). and the dress felt much more casual than i expected from the pictures online. that said, it\\'s a great dress and i am keeping it - just adjusting my expectations/what i plan to wear it for. The dress immediately caught my eye in the store. upon trying it on, i discovered that the slip runs extremely small (and unnecessarily so considering the looseness of the shift). the skirt is a tad long--i\\'m 5\\'6\" and it hits mid-knee. it\\'s a shame the slip was so tight--i loved the dress otherwise. I was very excited to receive this dress because of the cute photo. however, upon arrival i was completely disappointed. the color is much more drab than the photo. the smudged polkadots weren\\'t attractive. there were many little bumps and pulls in the linen. the dress is super heavy. the pleats around the waist did not lay correctly.\\nand it adds 10 pounds to your hips! super sad! i am sending it back. The cut and print of this dress is beautiful. however, the armhole is way too low, which is a reoccurring problem with anything sleeveless from retailer these days. please don\\'t drop the armholes so low, most women do not want their bra completely showing every time you lift your arm! These are incredibly soft and comfortable. they are only for inside lounging, because they are a bit see through and have that long-johns type of material on it. So, i bought 2 of these. first in xsp. it was actually the regular length not the petite one. it did have the problem mentioned by others regarding the arms, armpit, thighness issue. i thought maybe the dress was mislabeled and i got a regular xs by mistake. so i returned and order another xsp hoping i would get one with the right length, but no. the one i got has same issues as the first one. why 2 petite dresses with regular length/? i think the dresses are defective. the print is gorgeous and The shirt is darling, soft and relaxed fit. i usually wear an xs or small in most retailer tops. unfortunately, i ordered an xs and should have ordered the small. i found the length to be a little short in the xs so i\\'m sending it back to exchange for the small. i hope it\\'s just a little bit longer. Had to send back for exchange. way too big. i\\'m very excited to get a smaller size because they are really beautifully made. This is a beautiful top but the xs was literally 4-6 inches too wide. very disappointing! i am thin and tall but this was a maternity top on me. i don\\'t usually wear xxs. it is much more voluminous than it appears in the picture and it is definitely gray and blue not white. The models pose and description are misleading. this top has absolutely no shape to it. the front of the shirt is kind of like a slub shirt texture, plain black. the back print is nice,just more faded than shown in picture. the entire design has no form. it is huge. also cheaply made. Super cute dress online on the model. what you can\\'t tell from the picture is the slip underneath is not true to size of the dress and the outside layer of the dress is more sheer than the picture shows so you can tell the slip underneath is very tight. it might be my body type. otherwise, it\\'s super cute in person and i wish it would\\'ve fit better! I have been looking for a fall/spring coat to wear when the weather is between 30 and 55 degrees. this \"coat\" looks great in the pictures, but so disappointing in reality. the best thing i can say is that the fabric is soft. it is unlined, so i\\'m not sure why you\\'d even wear it -- if the weather\\'s warm enough to wear a thin, unlined jacket, why not just wear a sweater? the weight is not what i would expect at this price point. even worse, the design is terrible; my husband (who has a great eye) I wanted to love this sweatshirt, but alas, it is going back. upon opening and unfolding, the first thing i noticed: the dots and not solid. they are sort of distressed looking, with parts of them missing. secondly, it doesn\\'t have a lot of structure. it\\'s soft and kind of floppy but in a weird way. it\\'s just not flattering on me. it looks more like a pajama top than something i would wear out of the house. for reference, i ordered the 3, and i\\'m usually a 10/12 in tops. I ordered size large and find this to be way too oversized, wide, long and unattractive on my frame. the print is just okay but since it doesn\\'t wow me, i\\'m returning. In my opinion, the quality and uniqueness of this piece far definitely warrants a full price purchase. adorable cut and style, comfortable and cute. it\\'s the perfect flexible top to wear to work with a skirt or more casually with your favorite pair of jeans. love this! These pants are lovely and comfortable, but they are entirely too delicate. i wore them once and nearly any time something touched them, they snagged. i was worried about it when i saw the fabric, and thought i\\'d give it a try, but i didn\\'t think it would be this bad. for the price, i expect better quality. also, they run a little large- unless i pull the waist down low, it gaps in the back and these look better worn a little bit higher, closer to the natural waist. i\\'m usually a 4/6, 28/29 in b As a beach cover-up this would be great, but i\\'m surprised retailer calls this a dress and doesn\\'t show on the model how thin it is. it\\'s pretty sheer and i couldn\\'t get away without layering it. I wear med or large in most items. the medium was huge. fit like a moo moo. size down by at least two. Nothing wrong with the dress, sadly it\\'s the body i\\'m putting it on that\\'s less than perfect. fits fine and tts, but just doesn\\'t do anything for my bit wide hips, other than adds to them. hangs nicely, but jersey top and nylon bottom add to the wide hip issue. that said, i think i may still keep it as its a great length (not too short) and a nice, simple dress. really versatile. These run a tiny bit large, but i\\'m still keeping them. they are so soft and comfortable! This shirt is much more flattering in person. if i hadn\\'t seen it in store, i don\\'t think it would have caught my eye. i like the mix of casual and dressy this top has (i got it specifically for teaching). the one thing i noticed, however, was that the first xs i tried on looked very big on me. i tried a second on and the fit was much more flattering! i highly recommend that you try on the specific blouse you plan to purchase before you actually buy it. i\\'m glad i tried a second on, because i th I fell in love with this skirt when i saw it on display so i had the store order me an xspetite. it seemed like the perfect lightweight summer skirt that would go with everything. it arrived today and i was a bit underwhelmed with the way it actually fit on me. it is kind of a thick linen/cottony material and just didn\\'t lay down well, bunching out on the sides in a way i didn\\'t find to be very flattering. so 5 stars for print and whimsy and charm, but 3 stars for actual fit on. alas it is going If you have any curves, avoid! it is not flattering.\\r\\nthe striped side panels look odd with the flow of the dress. Tried small and medium and both were quite tight on the bottom. top is perfect. will return the bottoms and try the large. I love the pilcro serif legging jeans but these were a big disappointment. if you have any thigh at all don\\'t bother. I was so glad to find such a beautiful item made in the usa. i knew the workmanship would be above average. the embroidery is gorgeous and makes these jeans so unique. i am usually a 24 in pilcro slouchy chinos, size 0 in most pants , 25 in jeans so i ordered these in xs. the waist was at least 7-8 inches too large. they were enormous in every aspect of fit. no belt could possibly make these stay up. very disappointed . i would recommend an xs if you are a size 6 to 8. I ordered a medium in this and it definitely fits more like a large. i liked the color & the sleeves, but tying the tie at the neck looks silly on me and leaving it open shows too much cleavage. overall, it is just shapeless and too much fabric on me. i\\'m sending this one back. I love anna sui\\'s lines makeup to everything. this dress is beautiful in a very usual sort of way and after trying it on, i couldn\\'t see anything spectacular that made it unique or special somehow. the elastic waist does make this dress forgiving and it runs big. the hem is lovely scalloped. each detail is very nice in and of itself but when put together in this dress, there is no wow that justifies the full price tag. now that it\\'s on sale i\\'ll keep it probably for summer. Cute top, not great on me. beautiful, bright color. This dress is very pretty and feminine but was unfortunatly much too large for me. i ordered my regular xs and it was swimming on me. i also found the embroidery to be imperfect in several places (unraveling) and the placement of the embroidered designs were uneven at the bottom of the dress, which threw off the flow. the largest medallion was off center in the front of the dress and gave it a crooked effect. the material is nice and the pockets are a plus but i returned it. So i\\'m not sure if its just my body type or what, but this did nothing for me. the bottom, which i thought would be too big was actually too small in both the small and the medium (i\\'m a size 8 bottom) and then when i sized up to the medium it was still too tight and then the top was loose. i just think this one is going to take the right body type. it could look really beautiful on the right person, just not me. Great, special cardigan. fits like a shrug and a little short but is perfect over a tight fitting sheath. great for broad shoulders. I got my usual xs (i\\'m a 32b) and the top fit fine from the chest up. my head just fits through the hole on top without having to unbutton. but then from the chest down, the shirt billows out too far. it hits me at the hip like the model (i\\'m 5\\'6\" and wear 2/26) but because of the extra fabric it really needs to be longer to balance out the trapeze look. since the top portion fits nicely i almost want to keep it then have a seamstress take it in a little at the waist so it\\'s more a-line than tra Bought this in the store and fell in love with it. very soft and flattering to wear. however, after wearing it one day it is already starting to pill. this truly is a beautiful sweater, but i fear it will not be beautiful for long. i am willing to take the chance as i got it on sale. Dress is actually very cute - i like it better in person than online. the color is a very pretty deep denim blue color. it is cut very roomy/swingy. length is a bit too long in the back for my taste but still like the way it flows. i am very slight of frame and on me there is a lot of extra material but nothing a good tailor can\\'t fix in a jiffy. perfect for a summer day/bbq or casual party. So different loose linen, i love the raw edge and the color i can wear with anything over a dress...great top with raw edges This is a cute,somewhat dressy top-- it has a bit of a sheen, ties on the sides, and a zipper down the back. it\\'ll go great with pants or skirts. the fit, though, is huge-- i\\'m normally an 8, but i got this in a 4! machine-washable even though it says \"dry clean.\" if it doesn\\'t say \"dry clean only,\" you can wash it. I love this blouse. the color is so pretty! i might even wear this to a holiday party. the tie looks great so many ways--love the versatility. i think i will get a lot of wear out of this blouse--with a pencil skirt, jeans or under a blazer. This tank seemed like it should have been a maternity top. way too much fabric, not flattering for those of us with a larger bust. i am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40. Loved the dress, but the white of the dress was neon white, way too bright and made it look terrible against my skin. i can imagine this looking good on someone with darker skin. but i\"m my pale skin it looked bad. otherwise the fit was great, besides missing out on the petite sizes which are sold out. I have a holding horses dress similar to this one from about a year ago.  i loved the swinging fit without it looking like a maternity dress.   the fit and style of this dress is wonderful, it\\'s the color that killed it for me.   i ordered the \"orange\" because i liked the photo on the model.  when the dress arrived in the mail, i could hardly take it out of the package and try it on.   the color is almost neon orange.   too much for this redhead.  hard to wear that bright neony color.  not sure I wanted this jacket to fit on me like in the photo, but i guess my frame was still to petite. the fabric was also on the cheap end I loved this at first....but the quality is awful! it pilled like crazy and started to get little holes near the neck after 4-5 wears. second sweater from retailer this year with severe pilling issues. i love retailer, but will never again buy another sweater here. First of all, this skirt is as cute on as it is in the picture. very flattering. i am a curvy gal on the bottom and this is flattering. that being said, it runs small. i purchased a large which is my usual size, and i need another inch or two all over to make it work. part of the problem is the material. it is a very heavy, durable upholstery like material. there is absolutely no give to this. it is a very stiff material as well -- more what i would expect on a sofa than on my skirt. the skirt c I got this skirt in the dove grey, which is a lovely shade of light grey and silver. it has one layer underneath that is a sparkly silver netting which is really pretty that you can\\'t see in the photo. the other layer is the grey netting. it has a very soft light grey silky cotton liner. i got the petite xs and it fits just as it should. i\\'m 5\\'3, 102. the skirt looks just as it is pictured, i think it can be dressy or dressed down a bit. very very pretty and well made. i\\'m happy with the purchas Wanted to love this dress. the fabric is very nice, pretty colors, great quality and style. it just didn\\'t work for my body type. it would fit great on someone with narrower shoulders. probably want to size down. Really wanted to like this and took chances based on other reviews, even with the sale price and addtl discount. it\\'s basically $30 blouse fabric with design and detail-work of a much more expensive blouse. the white is sheer and and fabric will wrinkle easily. if it were black, you could probably get away with it, but the white shows too many flaws and will wrinkle. sad to have to send it back. I was surprised and impressed by how well made this top is. it looks and feels expensive and of good quality. it is a very flattering fit for someone like me who is small on top and wider at the hips area. i look forward to wearing this top all through the fall/winter/holiday seasons! Loved the look of this sweater online. was disappointed when i took it out of the package i was surprised at how stiff and itchy it was. i ordered my usual medium and though at first they shipped the wrong size it was small all over.  it felt cheep definelty not worth the high price. knew it was definitely going back I wear an 8-10 and these are a little big on me, which is surprising. they also don\\'t lay really flat in the back. the pockets are inside in the back, in side two layers, and don\\'t lay very flat. the crotch is low and rides up when i walk.\\r\\ni\\'ll probably wear them again, but i\\'m not totally thrilled by them. My conscience screamed at me not to buy this sweater and i wish i had listened! i noted the fact that it was acrylic and also the fact that it was oversized. but i also loved the design and can\\'t resist anything with mustard yellow. i was instantly disappointed when i received it, almost didn\\'t even try it on. how can they possibly charge $185 for terrible itchy 80\\'s acrylic? it looks cheap, it feels cheap and it didn\\'t even fit well. only redeeming quality: easily returnable! This piece is comfortable and easy to pair with leggings or denim. soft and not too heavy. I love this dress and bought it in the store in the orange, without trying it on as i usually wear a 12 in this brand.  the over-dress is beautiful, however the under-slip is very tight and is apparently made for some one who has no bust at all.  i am so sad and am considering returning it or re-sewing the slip in some way so that it fits.  not sure what to do. don\\'t want to spoil the color combo by wearing something different underneath, but it is so sheer you need something. I love this soft, glistening, flowy beauty!  it\\'s my favorite color too!  i\\'m 5\\'5\", 34d, size 6 and a small fit me with room to spare.  don\\'t wait! This is a very beautiful and well-made skirt. it looks a little like ribbon material. it is very think and lush, and the pockets add a little extra special to it. the waist band is very sturdy and it wears very flattering. even putting my hands in the pockets feels very thick and silky. i am 5\\'1\" with a 27in waist and the size 2 fit really well, just above the knee. I was expecting this to be longer. nothing wrong with it, i will be returning it because it was a little short. The other reviewers are right, this runs huge. why have a number of cute tops been running so large lately?! i\\'m 5\\'1 and 100 lbs and was drowning in the xxs petite. it also almost reached my knees. i thought it\\'d be a cute little tunic to wear in the fall but it just looks ridiculous because of how large it is and how there\\'s no taper or shape. maybe even order 2 sizes down. the quality is pretty good if you can make the sizing work for you. I love this in the red motif....looks great with jeans or white. for maeve, this runs a little larger. at 5\\'8\" 130 lbs, i typically need a 6 to keep the front from pulling/gaping. the 6 in this was roomy and the 4 was also good. took the 6 for a little extra length. the shirt hits be about like the model in length, and while a little cropped, it won\\'t show your stomach. I ordered two of these, the grey and ivory. i have had great luck with jackets and blazers from retailer. these were the exception. i just could not pull them off. the quality was great but they had little shape except being a bit boxy. i do have wider hips. maybe these would look better on someone tall and thin? for reference, i am 5\\'6 and about 138lbs. i ordered smalls and the sizing was perfect for me, the style was just off. i had to return both. Nice loose-fitting dress to wear in the summer and to transition into the fall. i had no problem with the slip being too tight. 5\\'3\\'\\', 118lbs, and went with my normal size 2. it was loose through the body but sizing down would have made the dress too tight on my shoulders. it\\'s great with boots or flats! Great dress, comfortable to wear and flattering, with the stretch cinch waist and the soft flare of the skirt i feel flirty and fun with its open scoop neck and dipping back. plenty of space and simplicity to accessorize or not. i bought it in black/white and red, each with its own feel. Although i love retailer, this product isn\\'t the quality or presentation i expect from them. the dress arrived stuffed into a small plastic bag and was a crumpled mess. the fabric wasn\\'t soft and fluid as i expected, but rather was stiff and a little scratchy. i purchased the ecru version, which was also slightly darker than the photo showed. i returned the dress and will keep looking. I had high hopes for this top. really boxy, short So glad i purchased this tunic! just lovely. can see myself reaching for it constantly this summer. necklace friendly too! I ordered size small and medium because i can go either way depending on brands. and both look great! there is no significant difference except medium fell about 1 inch longer. i am 5\\'4\" and size small hem fell about 1\" above knee. size medium felt tab bit more loose but i thought fabric may stretch a bit after wear so i\\'m keeping size small. what a beautiful dress! although the body of dress is jersey material, it is lined so there is good coverage. i tend to not like \"faux leather\" since they This top is just as beautiful in person as online. however, it has two issues for me. 1. it is too short. this might work if you have a short torso, but it would forever show my stomach. 2. the fabric has way too much static cling. no matter what i tried, it just clung to my stomach and flared out at the sides. not attractive. in short, if you have a short torso and don\\'t mind battling the static, this truly is a beautiful top. I had high hopes for this top based on the photos, but when it arrived it is a very thin cheap feeling top. the color is a dusty rose color that has a yellowish mottle throughout it, almost like a tie dye or slub effect.  not pretty at all. The material feels nice and i love the flared arms. I agree with a previous reviewer who said that it was very nicely cut, but unfortunately, the materials are so cheap. the \"fleece\" material that it is made out of feels like the cheap polyester fleece blankets that you get at the discount stores. it will pill easily, and is noticeable even in the dark color. i must have gotten one shipped straight from the store, and it was already starting to do some gnarly pilling. i do love the cut of it, but i can\\'t justify keeping it because this won\\'t last I like to wear swing tops because they are comfortable, not confining. this is definitely true for this top- i have an xs and it is quite spacious and boxy shaped. this is a simple cotton shirt but the ruffle adds a nice detail, and without being too much ruffle either. great to throw on with jeans! I love these pants! best fitting pants i\\'ve ever owned. flattering. stretchy/don\\'t stretch out. i am so sad that retailer didn\\'t plan well and stock enough. i bought the black, want the gray and all sizes but 25 and 31 are sold out. i might just buy another black pair so i can have another. i really wish retailer would re-stock these!!!! although these are 5star pants, i rated them a 3 for retailers poor / low stock quantity. This is truly a beautiful dress! the delicate fringe-like fabric throughout makes it unique and and the column silhouette with slight blouse-like top is elegant! perfect for summer with comfortable stretchy slip that comes with the dress! the material on the waist line stretches and is very comfortable. the bottom is pretty narrow so you need to take smaller steps. it does run large, i am 5\\'3\"/135lbs/34b and an xs fit perfect throughout as well as the length! only not so positive feature is how I took a chance on this top because i liked the style. i prefer natural fibers like cotton and linen. this is rayon and spandex. sure, why not at least give it a shot and go outside my box?! if the fabric would have been my preference, it would have been a keeper. i did not like the feel, nor the semi-sheer quality. maybe it would work for you, but not for me. back it went. I bought the bronze color which was nice but the cut just hung like a dust rag, no fit , no drape\\nvery unfinished looking. though i bought it on sale on sale, it is not worth keeping. over all it was not a worthwhile blouse to keep. Even following the care label exactly, it shrunk ~3 inches in the length and overall in the diameter. i had to return this since i am tall and it looked more like a work-inappropriate mini after the first wash. Just buy these! i bought the olive green color and loved them, so i bought the navy blue. they fit true to size, i\\'m a size 4 and bought the 27. they are comfortable and make your bum look good. i prefer skirts, dresses and shorter pants like these gauchos instead of shorty shorts during the summer, and these will be something i wear all the time in warm weather. you can wear them casually or dress them up. Bought the tan/taupe joggers today in asheville. so soft and comfy, will probably go back for navy ones. i found them true to size. will be a great, cute addition to my summer wardrobe. I loved this shirt when i got it. it fit perfectly, and was so soft. but when i washed it, following the instructions, it shrank up to well above my belly button. i\\'m talking 6 inches of shrinkage, at least. The skirt part of the dress falls straight and accentuated my stomach. you can\\'t really tell from the pic. but if you have even the slightest bump of a stomach the dress might make it look worse instead of better because of the way that it is cut. i\\'m pretty slim - 5\\'5\\'\\' and 114 pounds and it wasn\\'t doing me any favors! the top of the dress is beautiful! i will exchange it for something else. i ordered it online and couldn\\'t try it on before purchasing it. Love this dress. it\\'s a nice addition to my summer wardrobe. easy to wear. i am between a large and an ex large in dresses. i did order it in a large, it was a perfect fit but did exchange it for an ex large. i wanted it to have little more swing to it. I purchased this in the yellow for my daughter and she has not seen it yet. the style is very cute, but the fabric is quite thin. she will have to make that call, but if i had bought it for myself, it would be going back. i\\'m not willing to wear a camisole under a t-shirt. it also feels like the kind of knit fabric that shrinks and skews when it\\'s washed, so that remains to be seen. I really wanted to love this shirt! the colors are gorgeous, very vibrant and just as shown. the fit was all wrong on me. i ordered the petite xxs and it was still too boxy. and, it kept shifting so the front collar of the shirt would ride up into my neck. it looked like a sack on me. for reference- i am 5\\'2\", 112lbs...with a small frame. I\\'m keeping this top bc it was on sale but it does look a little maternity! i wore with super skinny white jeans and 3\" casual heel. i\\'m short so i needed a little more height to slim me but if your tall and and slender this might work better for you? This shirt fit really really big! i ordered an xl but think i could get away with a l, if not a medium. sadly, it\\'s going back :( otherwise, it\\'s high quality and a beautiful design. This is a well made blouse with a pretty neckline. the print with the sleeves makes me look really wide. it\\'s an odd look. After readying the reviews of this dress, i thought for sure i was purchasing a winner. boy, was i wrong! first, this dress feels like a potato sack and looked like one on. i felt that it was very boxy and more of a o\\' one size fits all\\' sizing. it did not embrace my curves at all. the material was not as chic as i would have thought. overall, the entire dress was not flattering. honestly, i do not understand what the rave reviews were talking about it. I love this dress which for me will double as tunic over leggings/tights. the fabric is very comfortable for fall into winter for southern california and looks super cute with booties or boots. this will be a mainstay of my wardrobe. This top is very pretty, but it doesn\\'t make up for the problems with it. retailer seems to be suffering from quality issues as of late. the sizes are all over the place and items i have purchased don\\'t seem to hold up to normal use and washing. i normally wear a medium in tops. the medium in this top was huge. i needed an extra small, which means a lot of people are sized out of this top. i hand washed this top in cold water as the tag indicated and it shrunk! it shrunk so much that i can I love this t-shirt - the moss green color is just what i wanted, cute fit and true to size. purchased the medium b/c i like t-shirts to be a little loose. I ordered a med petite. usually this fits but this shirt was long and the sleeves wouldnt stay down. as a regular shirt it was not cute. The dress does run large. i\\'m 5\\'4 and 135 and the xs fit great. it\\'s a very comfortable summer dress. have had many compliments on it. Good design, comfortable fit. however, sizing is way off. i am a 34c and the small fits with minimal support. agree with the previous review. not sure it is a keeper. Runs very large and way too much fabric. i wanted this top to work because it looks cute on hanger. i usually wear s/m and the xs had too much fabric. may work better on someone with longer torso and taller. i am 5\\'6.5\" 36c 126lbs I love this sweater. it is a beautiful color and i love the boxy shape. very soft. The color says red but it\\'s more like a rust. i\\'m 5\\'3\" so it was long and would need to be tailored and the fabric is so thin i was afraid it would rip if it got caught on anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nfinally returned it without it making it out the door :( Like the previous reviewer, the biggest problem with this shirt is how short it is. i\\'m 5\\'4 and ordered a 12, which is usually what i wear at retailer. even only being 5\\'4, this shirt is much shorter than i anticipated. it fits everywhere else, though. i\\'m obsessed with the back so i\\'m going to keep it and wear it. i\\'d say it\\'s worth it at the sale price. These are great, the colors are a little different in real life. they are really great but i think they are a bit delicate and i hope they hold up. When i ordered this online, i should have paid more attention to the picture. the dress comes to the knees of the 5\\'10\" model. i was swimming in small petite size. i checked the label and wondered whether i received the wrong size. nope, it was ps. either the dress was mislabeled, or this is cut huge. returning. too bad because the shape and color are cute. I was disappointed in this shirt. the color was not the pretty blue pictured, but rather a grayish blue which may look good on a brunette, but not on a blonde. the fabric felt like linen and wrinkled easily. normally, the quality of the fabric is one of my main reasons to buy holding horses, but this one felt cheap. the detail and craftsmanship was beautiful, and i wish this shirt would have worked for me. i waited for it to go on sale and was very excited to receive it. holding horses is one of Sadly, i had to keep only a few dresses, not all of them, so that one is in my wish list if my xs petite goes on sale in red and blue, i am pal so that is hte better color for me. i have not seen the green in eprson, but the neutral color is very nice too, if you are not into red.\\r\\n\\r\\nmaterila: thin-ish, strecthy, super comfortable, may be cool in a cold area though, brr.\\r\\n\\r\\nfit: xs petite fit perfectly everywhere, surprisingly, the shoulders are capped sleeves, i dind\\'t exepct having them \"fall\\' Gorgeous shirt! the detail on this shirt is impeccable! even with its boxy shape, it was very flattering on my petite, curvy frame. i\\'d say this shirt runs just a tad big. i\\'m 5\\' 118lbs and the xs fit perfectly. This should have been cute, but the fabric choice + ruching design made me look like i had elephant skin rippling around my waist -- super unflattering. This is a gorgeous top; however, it is very sheer and see through. maybe the fabric would have been better if it was a bit thicker? What a disappointment and for the price, it\\'s outrageous! I love this blouse, but after i got it i decided i really didn\\'t need another white long blouse. it was more of a want than a need. very stylish and comfy with nice neckline. i love retailer anything. i\\'m obsessed with this store and every single thing in it. even the smell just makes me happy when i enter the doors. Fabric much heavier than looks in picture. also nothing mentioned in the description. great color and fit but i live in florida. Got the blue & white striped in xs. fits perfectly. the arms are a little snug but it stretched to a comfortable fit. it\\'s very comfy and good quality fabric. This is a super cute tunic - it is simply way too big. I really liked the color and style of this dress, but the proportions were off. the top was too small and the waist was too large. if you are more uniform in size/shape and less of an hourglass this dress may be perfect for you! Oh such a classic retailer look for summer! a vintage pattern on a crisp cotton fabric. i was immediately drawn to it. but wait- there is a sort of wrap around tie at the waist, creating the look of an apron. yes. it looks like one is wearing a full apron. or scrub dress. \\r\\nwhy?? this would have been sooo much better as a simple shift or a skirt/blouse combo. The skirt is just okay. the design is great but the material is extremely thin and see through. there is a slip which goes to mid-thigh- very strange and felt weird as well. the pleats are okay but not great. overall, it is not worth paying full price for or anywhere near that. and again, be wary of it being see through. I bought this blouse in both the cream and the blue. both are lovely. i would say that the size runs a bit large, i bought size 12 and the bodice hangs away from my back, arms fit well though, loose fit. hangs well. the lace is nice and stiff. the cream has some cafe au lait shading on some of the lace so it could almost look stained. i don\\'t think that will be how it reads, though, but fair warning. This dress fits great and is very warm for the winter months. I took a chance on this top because i loved the color and print. it is mostly as pictured, but because i have a larger chest, the peplum didn\\'t hit me in the right place. it would probably work fine for someone thinner with a smaller chest. i was surprised that it was also somewhat sheer, which was disappointing considering the price. i returned it. I ordered this skirt and i was so excited when i first saw it. the photo doesn\\'t really do the colors justice. the contrast of the bright colors makes this skirt one of a kind. i returned this item however because when i tried it on, the pattern was just at the wrong place and emphasized the thighs for any of us pear-shaped ladies. the side profile of my thighs in this skirt was just horrible. This is a pretty dress, but it runs at least one size too large. the silk is of good quality. it would be good for somebody who is slim and tall. This is my go to, cool, summer dress. it\\'s very light and airy and extremely comfortable. great for 90 degree days!\\r\\nhighly recommend! The tights are thin and not how they appear in the photo. one of my pairs had a hole in the seat and it was obvious they had been repackaged with part of the packaging missing. very disappointing. i wish i had found the hole before i try them on. they are definitely going back. I\\'m so disappointed this dress didn\\'t work out! i ordered the size medium, post baby i\\'m a solid dress size 6 or 8 depending on the designer.\\r\\nthe cashier was laughing with me how ridiculously huge this garment was when i held it up. \\r\\n\\r\\nalso the length was super long, description says 35\" which would be mid thigh for me, but this thing hit me mid knee. also, like the previous review the shoulders are tented and poofy. so bizarre and the cut reminds me of a maternity dress, but the shoulders def I ordered my usually size, xs, and it\\'s just so wide and unflattering. looks like i\\'m wearing a tent. i don\\'t understand why tops anymore are either huge or skin tight. why not something in between?!  the pink color is really pretty and the details are nice but it\\'s just blah in terms of the fit. The beadwork is gorgeous, but the sleeves are so puffy, it looks as though you\\'re wearing shoulder pads. the fabric of the shirt isn\\'t that fabulous either. Very pretty dress. the color is much brighter in person - a little too bubblegum pink for me. i love the way the bodice fit but there was just too much material in the skirt which made me look hippier than i am. would have preferred the skirt to have more of an a-line cut I wanted to love this sweater but the fit is just awkward. it is very short and box and ends up being very short in the back. i am going to return this item. I am normally a m-l (170 lbs, 5\\'4\", 34dd). i ordered this top in a medium knowing it ran big, and it is huge. seriously, i could wear it as a dress. i like the whole loose and comfy top thing, but this is so massive it looks sloppy. i\\'m going try and return it for a small. hey, i like that i can wear a small! the green color really is pretty, and it\\'s so soft. just need a much smaller size. I am not a fray fan but this dress has a modern vintage look, and it looks tailored. check out the ruffle sleeves, surprising detail. size regular small falls right above my knees, perfect at the chest (i\\'m 5\\'2\", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips), but the sleeves are 2 inches pass my wrist. the ruffle sleeves are too pretty to be rolled up, so i got the petite s, sleeves at perfect length, torso fits better but length is an inch shorter (thank you, cloth and stone for finally making petite sizes). These are extremely soft but do run about one size too big with one exception; the opening to pull your feet through that bag nicely around your ankles is soooooo small that you have to work to pull the heel of your foot out. for me, these are dual duty pants; casual wear like to the grocery store or coffee shop trip and second as great soft pj bottoms. though the ankles are small, they do not feel tight at all because the fabric is really that soft. they work well with both my sneakers and clas These are perfect for pulling off a finished look, proper enough for teaching in yet fun enough for going out afterwards or just running errands. the polyester material is substantial, lined and easy care. the pockets lay flat but may not be very useful since the skort is pretty fitted. i plan on wearing these a lot this year!! I had been eyeing this top for awhile so decided to snag it when it went on sale. i\\'m still on the fence. i love the material and pattern but it is really long, and i\\'m 5\\'10\". it looks very roomy with jeans but i still want to try it with tights and boots to see if that looks better. overall i think it is a great piece. Love this so much because it\\'s so soft, pliable and fits wonderfully with all of my fall wardrobe.  i ordered the plum color, which looks brown to me.  was advised to size up and glad i did.  i bought large petite and my stats are 5\\'3\" 135# 38/28/35. I bought this shirt in a l, since i didn\\'t want it to be too fitted and was concerned a m would be. it is so boxy! it\\'s like a completely different shirt. i have no idea how it looks good on anyone, unless it is simply widened the larger the size. maybe a m wouldn\\'t be as wide and therefore as boxy, but this shirt is just a bad mess. returning. I would not wear this to bed - it\\'s almost too pretty! i\\'ve been wearing this top under sweaters and shells as the weather is moving from winter to spring - i think it transitions the comfort of plaid into warmer weather perfectly! it dips a little low on me in the front (34b/c), so it\\'s probably not for more professional settings. i like to wear it with a lacy bra-type top peeking out underneath. This jacket is a neutral color with a subtle print that adds great character. the stitching around the edges is cute. the shape is very flattering and not too boxy as some open jackets can be. a perfect layering piece! I thought it would be heavier than it is. it\\'s thin and more delicate than what i would expect for a winter sweater (it contains wool so not really suitable for spring/summer). it\\'s also shorter than it appears on the model and a little wider/boxier too. I love the off the shoulder trend but don\\'t like having to wear a strapless bra so this style caught my eye. it is cute and different and people compliment me on it. swingy but flattering and i got the turquoise but i like it so much i just ordered another one in the black and white stripe. Received this blouse to wear for the holidays and was not disappointed. the design of the shirt is to be relaxed and flowing. i usually wear a medium which is what i ordered. the shirt fit fine but i probably could of managed with a small if i did not want it as relaxed. so if you are between sizes, you might want to size down. if i did order a small, the sleeves might of been a tad short since i have longer arms. the shirt is sheer, so you will need a cami underneath. i wore a black one which w So cheerful and colorful! love these cozy pj pants! This dress would have been perfect in a medium petite. beautiful dress, wish i had sized down This is such a gorgeous and unique turtleneck from retailer. my favorite color is the nude and buttoned neck is really pretty. i\\'m 5\\'1 and 105 pounds and i got the small since i liked the longer length and did not want it too clingy. it is a personal preference but you may want to go up a size. as for the dry cleaning, i washed this on delicate cycle without dryer and it came out perfect. love this! 1. i\\'m 5\\'5\" tall, 140 lbs and 38 (36d) - 32- 40. i\\'m normally a size 10 in most brands, and in maeve in the past. this dress was too tight across my waist and hips in a size 12, so it runs very slim.\\n\\n2. this dress is very long waisted, so the top bunched up funny.\\n\\n3. the horizontal bar in the back is in the wrong place, and will not hide your bra strap.\\n\\n4. there are bra strap keep loops in the shoulders, but this is an off the shoulder top.\\n\\n5. the underarms bunched funny.\\n\\n6. the dress has h This dress is perfect for any occasion, it looks great with every shoe and is flattering on. This is one of the most special dresses i have ever owned -- and i am kind of a dress person. this one has beautiful detailing -- sheer sleeves, but the bodice and bottom half are lined. fits beautifully -- i am a little busty, so i was worried about all the buttons in the front not buttoning or popping open, but in addition to the buttons there are hidden hooks to ensure it stays closed, which is unusual and a reflection of the quality of the dress. i am 5\\'6\" and the length was just right, abou What a dress! the print, the feel of the fabric, and the overall fit of this dress, it definitely has the wow factor! i plan on wearing this dress to the kentucky oaks this year. i typically wear a 6 and sometimes a 4 in retailer dresses. i\\'m 5\\'6\\'\\' 130 lbs 32dd and took a 6 in this. i could probably even try the 8. it fit a bit tight in the bodice for me but i\\'m not sure if it warranted a size up. it is pricey but i see this being a closet staple and one of my favorite maxi\\'s yet. I got the grey in my normal size large and it fits as shown. love the cowl neck although it\\'s a bit awkward and oversized. the cowl is a lighter shade of grey and a nice contrast. it felt a bit itchy and is a tad boxy and short. i decided to return. I love this sweater! pros: great shape (it\\'s supposed to be a little oversized looking), great color (i have the ivory and it\\'s beautiful), and fits well (the sweater looks boxy until you put it on and it flows in all the right places). the sweater is not soft. that is my only con. it looks so soft in the photos, but the sweater i received is not at all soft and cozy. it is warm. it will be great for the winter - great pair with leggings, skirts or just jeans. The bra is comfortable and the design is good. however, the sizing is way off. i am a 34c and the small fits well with minimal support. not sure about quality. this one might have to go back :( This shirt had an overpowering vinegar odor when i took it out of the packaging.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe mint green color was appealing but the styling did not look good and the smell was too much. Love the coral color - so pretty in person. it is slightly lower cut on the chest than i expected. \\r\\nthis is a great top for the weekends! Delaine blazer so many little details with a slight bit of ruggedness. loved the unmatched buttons, checkered back and fraying that gave this piece personality making it appear less stuffy. easyily dress it up or down, that being said it seems to run true to size except the arms and shoulders were very tight. i would consider going up a size if more of an athletic build. ordered a 4 but i think a 6 would have been perfect! When ordering this product, i thought it was strange that the mediums were sold out. i went with the small which is generally what i wear. however, these run small and i see why the medium ran out. they are pretty, however, i wish they made them more true to size. I found it very thin and much more sheer than i expected. not sure i could get away with wearing it without a slip.sadly i\\'ll be returning it. also, runs a bit large. would have returned it for an xs if i loved it. I\\'m usually a maeve fan. i found this top to look cheap and fit poorly. it is also very thin material and showed everything. I waited three months for these pants. when they finally arrived, i was mostly pleased. they seemed like the staple pant everyone is raving about. and they should have been.\\r\\nproblem one: they bag out. i got one wear out of them before i needed to wash and hang to dry (regained shape then).\\r\\nproblem two: the crotch split! in the front! i\\'m a teacher. i sincerely hope no one noticed! i read other reviews about this problem and don\\'t know if i got a bad batch or if a similar fate is awaiting other For reference: 5\\'3, 130#, athletic/muscular body type (broad shoulders, slim hips)\\r\\ni\\'m a bit confused on the sizing for this, especially based on other reviews mentioning they needed to size up. i ordered the xs, and i was swimming in it. i usually am quite comfortable in size small, so i\\'m not sure why the xs was still too big. perhaps you need hips for this dress to work, because it was really just hanging on me and not figure flattering at all. i\\'m not sure if ordering the xxs would make thi Like other reviewers, i saw this dress on the cover of the catalog and knew i had to have it! well, i am very disappointed. the colors aren\\'t as rich as the outdoor photo, although they\\'re brighter than shown in the studio photos. this is just not a flattering dress. i\\'ve put it on three times and taken it back off. the neck is too high, the sleeves are too narrow (and i have really skinny arms), and there\\'s no \"swing\" to it. i am 5\\'4\" and weigh 120 pounds and bought a size small, which is what The print doesn\\'t necessarily works for everybody. I thought this dress would be a cute beach cover up so i was excited to order it but i was very disappointed. i am 5\\'7 and i usually wear a size small top and 4 dress so i ordered a small in this dress but it was huge!! i understand that it is not meant to be form fitting and i wasn\\'t expecting it to be but when i tried this on i felt like i was wearing a potato sack. i feel like an extra small would have been just as bad. i was so upset. it also has thin silver lines through it which, for me, m I tried these on because the color is really pretty and fun, and who donse\\'t want a pair of comfy/cute pants... but they looked awful on my muscular thighs... i don\\'t think the cut will be falttering on 99% of the population. also, not as comfortable as they looked, the crotch seemed a little \"low\" on me, though the pants were in the correct size. I loved the design and light weight quality. reference i\\'m 5\\'4, 125..i ordered a small, it\\'s a tad big but i can handle it. because of the neck line, you must wear a strapless bra. This sweater is super cute and i so wish it worked for me. i am but i must like sweaters a little longer than everyone else because this just hit me at the wrong place. if you\\'re still trying to work off that last little bit of your baby bump, even 2 years removed, this hits right there and emphasizes your waist, at least on me and i\\'m 5\\'5\". it\\'s so cute that i might have kept it to see if i could get it to work for me but it still has the ink tag on it so it has to be returned no matter what an Wore it a couple of times, it is cool and comfortable. washed it and the raw edges are starting to fray. i might get one or two more wears out of it. hand washed and hung dry. A serious joke. i struggled with the buttons for a good 10 minutes and gave up after the 3rd button. i\\'m not sure what they were thinking. This shirt runs big, it\\'s very long. material is very pretty and it is lined. i am keeping it for that spontaneous need to wear something sparkly...dinner party maybe? Very disappointed. the cutouts started to rip the first time i wore it. i\\'ve only worn it twice and i love it but the cut outs are embarrassing. I bought this blouse in a size 4 (my normal size) to pair with winter white slacks and gun metal pumps. it was a hit. i felt beautiful and professional. and received many compliments at work as well as at an after work gathering the quality is surprisingly sturdy given the lace work. the collar and cuffs really set the design off. this top is much more impressive in person. Love the fabric of this button-down. runs really large, however. am usually a small or xs - so bought a 4. it\\'s ok, but is incredibly boxy and stands away from the body -- & not in a good way. i think it probably works well tied at the waist, but, alas -- i am too old to be showing off that part of my anatomy. returned reluctantly! hope others will enjoy! I absolutely love mother jeans, but i unfortunately had to return these ones. this particular style seemed to run pretty small. too, i always size up in white jeans, and even the size up that i had ordered were just too tight. i typically wear a 28 in mother, and ordered a 29 in these. I love this onesie! i get a lot of complements when i wear it. the only issue is that it\\'s slightly too short in the mid section. it tends to give a tiny bit of a wedgie. but it\\'s not nearly significant enough to give it a bad review or return it. overall it\\'s comfortable. i did have to size up because of that issue but it still looks great. I finally found these jeans!! love them and have been wearing them almost everyday! This dress is so pretty. i loved the details on it. the material was ok. would have prefered a softer material so the bottom part of the dress would have been more flattering. unfortunately, it did not fit me right. i\\'m 5-2\",34c, 28, 37 and the 4p fit ok. it hit just above my knees so the length was fine. what i did not like was that it was a little too loose around my waist making me look pregnant so unfortunately i had to send it back. i\\'m so sad cause this is a really pretty dress. you can dr These tights are awesome! i bought three pairs. they give a nice casual look to some of my multi-season dresses. This top is so unbelievably cute! the fit is perfect and it goes with just about anything on the bottom. i personally styled mine with high waisted distressed skinny jeans and it looks adorable. its a tiny bit see-thru, so you do need to wear a tank under it. This dress fit so oddly. i tried on two different sizes and both did this super unflattering poochy thing at the belly. the dress wasn\\'t tight at my hips in either size, it was just that there was weird extra fabri right around the midsection that stuck out. maybe i was too short? couldn\\'t figure it out. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe color and detailing are beautiful though! a little tight in the bust. This a beatifully made top - it does run large so i sized down. it has a very floaty quality but it truly lovely so i kept it and glad i did - i\\'ve had many compliments! have run a ribbon through the holes around the waist once to pull it in and it worked really well - it\\'s convertible! Beautiful. did not look like much on the hanger, but this is a beauty. give it a try!\\r\\ni am 5\\'10; normally a size 6 and the small fits perfectly. it should be loose fitting, with a dropped, not so obvious flounce. the colors are subtle and it will go nicely with many lightweight summer pants and shorts! I\\'m normally a small in retailer tops. i ordered a small, and the top fit well in the shoulders and in the upper (more fitted) part. it all went horribly wrong from there. the top billowed out at the bottom and fit like a circus tent, instantly adding a good 50 pounds to my frame. this was such a disappointment, as the pattern is beautiful and the fabric is high quality. I saw this dress online and loved the colors and whimsical embroidery . i thought it would be the perfect dress to wear on the weekend with cute sandals. i was excited when the dress arrived in the mail as the colors were vibrant and the material was soft and cozy. unfortunately this dress is huge. it is a rectangle with pockets. i bought the xxsp, my usual size and this dress was so big my sister was able to fit in it with me.this dress was beyond alterations. too bad it was a great idea but no There\\'s a reason the model is holding her arms up in all the frontal views. it hides the very weird wide top part of the sleeve that absolutely destroys and distorts an otherwise beautiful blouse. the print is lovely but the fit is very odd. it\\'s pulls at and is very tight through the bust too. i wear medium or large and ordered size large. if you\\'re less well endowed this might be an okay choice for you. but i have to say this blouse made me look overweight and very wide. returned. These are terribly unflattering the wash looks dirty and the rise is not 10.5 like the description says, which is the only reason i gambled on these it is 13\". I love a cropped pant but these do not hit the mark. the pant would have been more flattering if they hit just above the ankle instead of the calf. i think they make the leg look stunted. the material was a nice weight and good quality but the bow being attached was a big design flaw. it look cute tied but would have been much nicer if you could remove it when needed. This sweater is fine for the casual days. i bought this in cream and i have to say after one wash it looks old. i\\'m a huge retailer lover and buy a lot of clothes from them. this is just not the best quality and looks tired after a few wears. very soft, but poor material. not my favorite purchase. This sweater is the perfect sweater except for one thing.....it sheds everywhere. i can simply pick up the sweater and shake it in one hand and 40 large pieces of lint go everywhere on the ground and on you. if you like dark jeans- don\\'t purchase. before i walked out of the store- the salesperson had to use a delineator on me- it was hysterical. sheds so much The color and quality of this sweater are fantastic. the reason i only gave it two stars is that the height of the neck didn\\'t seem right to me. it looked awkward and too high to be left standing upright, but when folded over i wished it were higher so it formed more of a turtleneck/cowl. i will be returning the sweater because of that. This shirt is way too flowy and the pink color is extremely washed out- will definitely be returning! I ordered a med petite. usually this fits but this shirt was long and the sleeves wouldnt stay down. as a regular shirt it was not cute. This dress looks and feels classy and expensive! every time i wear it out i get compliments on the color and style. I love the design of this dress, but found it to be an odd fit. the bow in back didn\\'t cover my bra, and in fact, though the overall fit seemed right, the bust was tight unless i removed the bra (which is not an option in my book). i\\'m not large-chested, so this seemed like a design flaw to me. Fits true to size. very feminine. it\\'s great with skinny jeans. not quite the length of tunic I\\'m happy i bought this top. it\\'s very cute and almost a little immature/childish, but with the right bottoms it looks classy. i found it to run large so i sized down one size and it fits good, though the straps can feel a little tight if it rides up. it washes beautifully. will probably not work on large chested women. I really love this shirt! i ordered the orange and am considering getting the other color too. it\\'s very comfortable and cute. i got a lot of compliments when i wore it. this shirt definitely runs large and i had to exchange the medium for a small. the looser cut makes it very easy for this to look like a maternity shirt, so i\\'d advise everyone to size down. The colors weren\\'t what i expected either. the dark blue is much more vibrant and i just couldn\\'t find anything to really go with it. fabric is thick and good quality. has nice weight and movement to it. the skirt just wasn\\'t for me, in the end. I love this top!! fits perfectly, and not too long. i\\'m 5\\'4\", 112 lbs and a 32dd and the small fits like a gem.not too fitted, but not boxy. i like that it covers my waist, but isn\\'t too long, either. i may order another one i love it so much! I want to like this sweater. the color is lovely, more of a grayish blue, and the design is nice. the quality is amazingly good, as it\\'s thick without being too thick and very soft. but the design is odd and quite unflattering! i got the xsmall but it\\'s two big. the sleeves have a very low shoulder so they almost have a wing like look. it doesn\\'t look like it does on this model. the waist area is a lot bigger, so it does sit on your hips, however the sweater isn\\'t slimming cause of the odd shape I just purchased this adorable top at my local retailer store, not really expecting to find anything, i saw this one so i tried it on in my usual size small and it fit me perfectly (34d-27-35). i bought the black with the colorful print and think it\\'s even prettier in person. it looks cute with the ties either open or closed and the material is nice and soft. also, the arm holes aren\\'t too large which is always a nice plus:) I was really happy when i saw this romper online and ordered it right away. unfortunately being larger chested i thought i would size up to a medium. bad choice. now i have a beautiful romper that is too big for me. i will be getting this one tailored. I love jumpsuits for their style and comfort. i loved the look of this blue silky piece, and the review that said it was like lounge wear you could wear out of the house. i agree that it is like lounge wear, but for me, there were a few challenges.\\r\\n\\r\\nfirst, the fit was small. i am usually anywhere between a 2 and a 6 depending on style, cut and brand. i tried the small in this and it was not a flowy look or feel. it was restrictive in the hip area in a way that would make me not want to wear th Loved the sweater and the sale price was great, but i could not take the shedding! even after just trying it on the first time, my jeans and top had shedding all over them. this was 2 minutes, i could not imagine what i would look like if i wore it all day. had to return. Sctrachy, short, boxy, stiff.\\r\\nloved the idea of this sweater, but this was not what i was hoping for The fabric and style on this swing tee are really nice but be aware it runs really, really large. i downsized on my order because of the style but it wasn\\'t enough. like wearing a tent. i would recommend it but know its very full. i did return it. I didn\\'t think it was that cute in the picture online but when i saw it in the store i was in love!  i am typically a medium and this was true with this.  i have a 34dd chest and you can wear a strapless easily with it and it doesn\\'t show. i am going to wear it for a cocktail party but it would work with flip flops too.  just love it so happy i went into the store and saw it. I\\'m upset. i ordered the grey sweatshirt and while the description says the sweatshirt has a zipper, the picture of the grey does not have a zipper. i prefer no zipper, so when it arrived in the mail with a zipper, i was disappointed. it\\'s going back. why have a model where an item that you\\'re not offering??? I tried these jeans on at the suggestion of the salesperson and couldn\\'t walk out of the store without buying them even at full price of over $200 which i don\\'t usually spend on jeans.. first of all, the material is so buttery soft you can\\'t believe you are wearing jeans, secondly, i could actually find a pair that would fit my smaller waist in comparison to my larger than i wish hips 27-28 waist, 38-39ish hips... 5-4 i ended up with size 26... they are very thin and i worry about how they will This top has a really pretty pattern and is good quality, but was just too boxy for me. i also felt like the sleeves were a little odd/big. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe fit is tts, though slightly shorter then it looks on the model. ...there\\'s enough room for a small family to live under the chest and trunk area of the blouse! sorry-had to say that! all kidding aside-since it\\'s been thirty plus years ago since we were wearing these, many of us have forgotten what peasant blouses truly fit like. this is no exception- it is very billowy, flouncy, and roomy-more so even than today\\'s peasant styles, i think. it is lovely and quite fitted across the chest -so that\\'s how i ordered my size and it worked. i think if one sizes down The print doesn\\'t necessarily works for everybody. This sweater is big and box. it looks very similar on as it does on the model. as other reviewers have mentioned, the embroidery on the shoulders is a bit itchy. I loved this top. loved it. the quality and color ( i got the red) are wonderful. the top fit perfectly through the chest and the a-line design was super flattering through the waist. however, i am long waisted and the top was simply too short on me. even when worn with mid-rise trousers, my belly showed when i leaned to the side or reached my arms above my shoulders. i so hoped it would be perfect with skinny jeans or leggings - as shown on the model - but on a long-waisted frame it is simply t I\\'m 5\\'6\" about 120 and usually a 0/2 in retailer... the size 2 in this skirt fit at my natural waist perfectly with enough room to move comfortably. on the hanger and from the photo i didn\\'t think i\\'d like it, but once on it\\'s really pretty and the fabric looks so nice, it has great movement, and is really flattering. I love jumpsuits but this literally feels like pajamas. it doesn\\'t look like pajamas but it is soft and cozy and isn\\'t too big or too tight anywhere. i am 5\\'6\" and 130 and i purchased the small and it fits just like the model. the button in the back at the top is a little hard to close but the whole thing comes off and on easy which is such a bonus in a jumpsuit. this is a winner! it can be worn casually or dressed up. I\\'m 5\\'1 and 110 pounds and i ordered the 26 petite. the jeans are fabulous...flattering....comfortable...i could go on and on. the fabric is super soft and the fit hugs in all the right places. it is a nice flare bottom. i will have to wear these with heels or wedges, they are too long for flats. I love this tee so much i bought in every color available. i have received so many compliments on each one! so soft and comfortable and easy care. I love this, despite the split sleeves. the day it arrived i paired it with a black boucle midi skirt (from retailer) jewelry and mid high black slings and we to out to dinner with friends. several people complimented me so it must have looked as i\\'d hoped. i have worn it one other time with straight legged pants and a cashmere cardigan and felt comfortable and a bit more dressed up than usual slacks, jeans and shirts. it is soft, feminine and comfortable...the ubiquitous \"dress it up or dress it Ordered this top online, color is a little more gray than green but it is gorgeous, comfortable and flattering, so much so, i am ordering the navy too. great quality , fabulous with jeans . It\\'s a nice drop-waist, embroidered, lightweight dress for summer. my problem was that the armholes were too large for me and i found that to be unflattering. it\\'s a swing style so it\\'s forgiving in the hips and belly. I normally wear a medium in about everything and i bet an xs would\\'ve maybe fit me in this top. it\\'s so billowy and not fitted at all. I am so excited about this swimsuit. i have never felt so good in a bathing suit. it\\'s sexy without being too revealing. the fit is perfect. i absolutely love it! I ordered the xxs petite (only size in petite left at the tme0 and that was right for me. i usually (should say used t) get xs but with the looser styles lately, xxs seems to fit me better. hte leg hem falls below my knee, but not too low on the calf. the waist is comfortable, hte weird part is the fabric, the sash part seems to be lighter and the softer part is on the inside so it would seem.\\r\\n\\r\\nfor reference, i am 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist. The fabric is lovely and the straight leg cut makes these pants a great option for summer. they do run small. I hesitated purchasing this because of the high price, so kept waiting and then the petite sizes ran out so i figured i missed it. then miraculously the petite in the green was available so i went for it. this sweater is yummy and cozy. drapes beautifully. i am 5\\'1\" , short waisted, and wear size 2 in most clothes. the petite s fits perfectly. with a pair of black leggings and high boots, this is a winner outfit for fall and winter. very comfy. the sweater has a bit of an open-weave, so keep tha I bought the green and white and waiting to see how these wash based on previous reviews. they are definitely not figure flattering and make you a bit boxy. you could belt it, but i won\\'t i\\'ll just wear for errands and lounging, better than my sports tees! i bought mediums because if it shrinks a tad, the small might be too short in the arms and i wanted a bit more arm coverage. Probably should have returned this but it\\'s just so pretty. i got complements from strangers the very first time i wore it but it\\'s extremely long. tucking it in will be tough-where do you put all that length? aside from that it is beautiful. the embroidery is soft and delicate light blues, gold, neutrals. hard to see in the pic but there are textured polka dots all over the shirt. great buy-i just wonder how i\\'ll wear it or if the length will be too much and it will become a \\'closet sitter\\'. I generally don\\'t write bad reviews, but there is a real discrepancy between the quality of this kimono and the cost. the design and colors are great, but the fabric is ripping on all the kimonos on the rack in my store where the manufacturer\\'s tag is at the back of the neck. the material is very thin, so there are other small holes beginning throughout the garment. i shop at retailer all the time, and this is not a $98 item of clothing. This is a beautiful dress and it was hard to let it go but, unfortunately, because the fabric is a little stiff, it accentuated my curvy back side in a bad way. it will definitely look great on someone with a smaller bottom. i tried the xs and did not experience the issues that other reviewers mentioned, such as the large arm holes. I bought this (because it looks beautiful, is well made, and a high quality piece). when i got it home and tried it on, it did not achieve the look i was going for (boho). instead, it was very drapery and full and big and i felt like i was wearing a ghost costume on halloween. i do love retailer\\'s kimonos and thought i\\'d love this one. but it\\'s going back. i don\\'t need any more clothes in my closet that i do not absolutely love and want to wear again and again. that is my new criteria for purchasi I wanted to like this one.. really but it was just plain sloppy looking. i returned it. So unflattering! really disappointed. made me look 6 month pregnant and i\\'m a petite size 2. I love my very old pilcro stet jeans. they are the perfect denim weight, and the back pockets are set in a way that is very flattering for the tush. not so with the newer pilcros unfortunately. the denim is thinner and may have more stretch and they get worn and pill on my inner thighs. and the back pockets are set far apart making my back side look unnaturally wide. it\\'s a bummer. The size s arm holes are a little too over-sized and i find i keep adjusting the shoulders so the sides of my bra won\\'t show (and sizing down to an xs made the body too tight). it\\'s a bit pricey for a basic, thin tank, but it\\'s a good every day, wear all the time staple. This blouse is stunning on the website ;however, it is totally sheer which you cannot tell from the photo. i was very disappointed and will be returning. It\\'s hard to tell how jeans will fit when shopping online. i was very pleasantly surprised. they are super soft, very high quality and look even better in person. i\\'m 5\\'3 118 lbs and i ordered the 27p and may have to get them taken up an inch, but they fit perfectly through the hips and come in at the knee. i\\'m big in the hips and small in the waist and they fit perfectly. highly recommend for petites out there! I\\'m keeping this blouse anyway. i purchased the olive and it\\'s such a great color. i live in a warm climate and really don\\'t need long sleeves, but since the color is so great and pairs well with a lot, i will keep it. No. this is one of the most unflattering things i\\'ve ever put on my body. i\\'m a very well-proportioned hourglass - i tend to wear a small despite a booty and 36d chest - this made me look huge. don\\'t do it. I purchased the blue color and it\\'s gorgeous. i\\'m 5\\'7\" and the length is perfect, not too billowy and not too tight. the fabric is a nice gauzy, summer weight. Even following the care label exactly, it shrunk ~3 inches in the length and overall in the diameter. i had to return this since i am tall and it looked more like a work-inappropriate mini after the first wash. This dress is comfortable and a great piece to travel with. goes with ballet flats, sandals, to ankle boots. I\\'m 5\\'8\" and a 2/xs and this fit well in size 2, waist was actually a bit loose. unfortunately the waist hit at least 2\" too high -- on my ribcage. not cute or flattering. that was the only flaw. would be perfect on someone about 5\\'6\". otherwise the dress looked exactly as pictured. love the boho vibe of this dress, the lace, sleeve length, and cotton material. could easily be dressed up or down. the style feels a little edgy - not too sweet. i am so sad to return this. Very comfortable nightgown, love that it had pockets. fit is as expected. There\\'s a reason the model is holding her arms up in all the frontal views. it hides the very weird wide top part of the sleeve that absolutely destroys and distorts an otherwise beautiful blouse. the print is lovely but the fit is very odd. it\\'s pulls at and is very tight through the bust too. i wear medium or large and ordered size large. if you\\'re less well endowed this might be an okay choice for you. but i have to say this blouse made me look overweight and very wide. returned. I love these, but i should have ordered the size 25 instead of my usual 26. i can wear them higher with a tight belt, but they are still too long. too cute to return though. I really love the fit of this dress. i said it runs true to size, and it really does--even with the stretch fabric around the back and adjustable straps, i would not recommend sizing down as i normally do at retailer--there is no stretch to the actual fabric on the dress. i\\'d never bought anything by this brand before, and i would say that the fabric is quite thin for the price of the dress, and it is not lined (i\\'m still hoping it\\'s not see through). however, for me, the style makes up for I ordered the neutral one with the fine stripe. it will layer nicely with neutral colored sweaters and blazers. the fabric is soft. the quality is good. the neck is cool that you can wear it two ways. overall, it is a good top. i think it\\'s a little clingy, which highlights every flaw, in the back especially. i wouldn\\'t size up. i still think it fits tts. The concept of this top is edgy for a sweatshirt fabric. i think it works better on a thin frame instead of my curvy frame. although i appreciate the design, it did not work for me. This dress had an odd fit. very loose on top with pointy darts, very tight on bottom. fabric was stiff so it didn\\'t move well with me Wow this is huge! i\\'m all for the tent-look with the right style, but this was absurd. i could have fit two of me into the width, and with the peplum style, extra width doesn\\'t flatter anyone. the fabric is also so thin that it doesn\\'t hang nicely, it kind of floats around the body. if you want a wide top, then this is perfect, but if you wanted something that hangs nicely, look elsewhere. i purchased a petite s, my typical size. I was drawn to this blouse because it was silk and looked so well made. the color palette is an added bonus. i knew for my height to size up because it looked short. i tried on the 12 & felt it was still to short. i would have to wear a 14 or 16 to get the length i would like. i think overall this would be a great buy for a person with a smaller bust or shorter. i am 5\\'8 1/2 & a 36d. I agree with the other reviewers - the fabric is beautiful - although i wish they would start making blouses again that didn\\'t require you to wear a cami underneath because of sheerness. i mean for the price shouldn\\'t it be lined or something. when did our expectations on fabric quality get so low. but i knew going in that it would be sheer so i can\\'t really complain too much. plus they are so loosely sewn on that after 20 minutes and only half the buttons undone one fell off. i gave up at that After seeing this dress online and noticing how quickly it sold out, i was curious about it, but thought i was out of luck. it just so happened that i ran into the store and they had one returned in my size. i tried it and wasn\\'t sold. however, i loved the color. it was snug across the shoulders and arms. the rest was somewhat flowy, but boxy at the same time. i ended up bringing it home to think on it. after trying it on again, i realized the snugness across the shoulder really caused the top t I love this top! it\\'s well-made (important if you\\'re in chlorine or salt water) and has vibrant colors. the back strap has two clasp options, so not much room for adjustment but i like this fastening method because you don\\'t have a big bow to lay on when laying out. The fabric and cut of this blouse are beautiful, but the v was so deep i could never wear it without a cami and i think that would ruin the look. i have a large chest, but the similarly cut blouse (without the textured fabric - from the same designer) fit me fine. this one is just cut differently. i even tried sizing up and down - to no avail. the photo on the model seems misleading because i don\\'t see how the neck would lay flat or stay that high on anyone - even with a smaller chest. i was so This is one of those you can tell from the hanger that it\\'s not going to work. too boxy. too short. and the girlish ruffle makes it look like an over-sized child\\'s shirt that got all messed up in the washing machine. I bought this shirt in a l, since i didn\\'t want it to be too fitted and was concerned a m would be. it is so boxy! it\\'s like a completely different shirt. i have no idea how it looks good on anyone, unless it is simply widened the larger the size. maybe a m wouldn\\'t be as wide and therefore as boxy, but this shirt is just a bad mess. returning. Love the dress! feel it fits true to size or slightly larger...knocked off a star as my dress arrived without the slip liner. i luckily have a slip that works from another dress...the beading is a lovely surprise! subtle and just enough sparkle in the sun, but not too much. If you love the print then this is the dress for you. it is so incredibly flattering for hour-glass shapes. and it has pockets! i wanted to keep it but i just did not like the pattern and every guy i showed it to hated the pattern. if they had it in a different color, i would buy it in every color. :) This pull over is so easy to wear, very comfortable and has a great bohemian vibe. it\\'s quality seems higher than what i was expecting- lots of details, tassels, fringe and hood. i travel a lot for work internationally and it\\'s become my go-to for the plane, dinners and excursions- makes a boring outfit looks effortlessly cool. would love to see more items like this pullover in the store this fall. Absolutely loved this top but after i washed it the underside color ran at the stitching. it is all white on the outside but at the bottom hem it has a really cool 1\" lining in a mustard color. i did a cold water wash and flat to dry. i noticed around the stitching at the bottom the mustard color has bled through just at the area of the mustard color stitching. \\r\\n\\r\\ni am so disappointed b/c i loved this top. I definitely trend towards preferring my clothes looser as a style but the fit on this dress felt a bit too boxy, i typically run between and x-small and small, should have gone with the x-small. i loved the print and quality of the dress though and would recommend it! Very very boxy design/cut. try on first or buy knowing you are 90% likely to return. beautiful skirt but if you don\\'t have the right body type/measurements, will not flatter you at all. This skirt looks and feels cheap, and the color is much more green than pictured. additionally, i comfortably wore a size 4 and then lost a few pounds, and this is still way too tight to be flattering. I wanted so badly to love this dress, but i couldn\\'t get past the thin material that you can actually see through. not for this price anyhow. the dress is shorter than i had anticipated, and more fitted around the waistline flaring out at the bottom which i feel isn\\'t accurately portrayed in the photo. on the positive though, the color is beautiful and the neck line stunning, but alas will be returning. Love this top, just received it today.\\r\\nit is a very artistic interpretation for a casual top.\\r\\nthe blue is gorgeous!\\r\\nthe unique style of the peplm and the details on the front set this apart!\\r\\nruns a little shorter, but i feel the length enhances it;s beauty, and is appropriate for the overall design.\\r\\nlove !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\r\\nordered my usual size and it fits perfectly. Thank goodness for a nice white basic tee that is not see through! i go back and forth between an xs and s depending on how i want an item to fit - i don\\'t like things to be too form fitting because i still have a little post-baby pooch. i went with a s in this shirt and it works well. my only complaint is that the neckline is not totally straight - where the seam comes up from under the arm to hit the neckline it bumps out a little bit. but it\\'s a great nicer basic that will go well with almost I was so excited for this dress.. but sadly it did not meet expectations. the gauze fabric already had several snags/pullers in it. the underslip was very short and just cleared my derriere.(i\\'m 5\\'7\") i normally take a 10/12 and ordered this in a l.. it was somewhat clingy in the hip area but yet bulky on top. also, i like to have the first button open, but you could then see the v neck of the underslip and it looked hokey. it\\'s definitely a thicker material than the previous plaid tunic holding Was really excited to get this, but got it on and i was swimming in it. i\\'m not a tiny girl thicker athletic build and the large was massive. sadly had to return. don\\'t know if i\\'ll try a size down. I really loved the way this shirt looked on me. it\\'s forgiving and flattering, and really lightweight. the fabric, however, couldn\\'t even withstand half a day\\'s wear without snagging 3 times and developing a hole right in the center. i have no idea how this happened, as i wasn\\'t wearing or near anything that could have pulled at it. \\r\\n\\r\\nsuch a shame. this could have been a staple wardrobe piece for me. This dress has been in my inbox for a long time and when it went on sale i purchased it right away. i am a size 4 petite in everything retailer and have not had a problem with fit, if anything i might have to size down. i purchased a 4 petite in this dress and i couldn\\'t zip it all the way up. it was as if i was trying to get into a 0 petite.  i don\\'t even think a size 6 would fit. there is something not right with the make of this particular dress i received. even if the fit was perfect i didn\\'t Uhm no. oh dear, no. i was initially drawn to this blouse\\'s lovely fabric, the color and pattern are truly stunning. i decided to give it a try because it seemed somewhat boxy, oh boy was i right. sadly, this is one of the least flattering tops that i\\'ve ever tried on at retailer. it might be a great maternity top, though. I was hesitant to order this top since i didnt know how well the design would be made on the front. i liked it, but sometimes items are different when you get them. this shirt was as pictured! the design is well made and there are no stray strings and i think it\\'s probably one of the nicer designs available. the top iis a dressier fabric but can be worn with jeans as well as dress pants. also, some shirts with this cut are skimpy in the front and leave more skin exposed than what you see here. t I love the dress as shown in the photo. thankfully i had a chance to see the dress in the store. it is sheer. can see thru it. can not wear this to work. Love the draping on this top - covers the stomach area, and looks great on curvy girls.\\r\\ni am between sizes, and ended up purchasing the m. fits well. i chose the mauve, which is more of a light gray/purple. Shoulders hide bra straps well - relaxed, but flattering fit. comfy, but can be dressed up! I can always count on retailer to sell unique pieces, so when i saw this sweatshirt online, i ordered it right away.  it&#39;s adorable and quirky, however, when i received it in the mail, it reminded me of something my grandma would wear.  the sleeves are puff sleeves and are really long, while the bottom of the sweatshirt hit pretty high on my waist that when i raised my arms my stomach was showing.  if this was a more tailored sweatshirt, i would be keeping it, but sadly it&#39;s going back. These are super cute shorts - great pattern, pockets (yay!) and really nice fabric. but, they\\'re just a little too short for me, run a little small, and the side zipper is something of a pain -- i don\\'t know if it was a construction issue on the pair i received or a stupid user issue but it seemed as if the seam with the zipper was just off -- not really a side seam but more toward the back. plus, the zipper sticks on the waistband seam making it even more difficult to zip. i wish i had read the I love the color block concept but this top was way too boxy. the shirt was pretty much square. and the top was super itchy, too. looks so cute online but no-go in person. This dress is beautifully made, but it does not flair slightly as in the photo, it stick out like a tent. it might be a good maternity dress. the fabric is somewhat stiff andheavy with a slight texture. The dress is too loose and runs too big I wanted to love this shirt. i like the style, the material is soft but it was so short on me. perhaps i just have a long torso but it fit everywhere else. i wasn\\'t even able to tuck it in because the sides just were so short. So disappointed. i love retailer! this was a huge disappointment. i am 5\\'3\" and 120 pounds. when i put it on, all i could think was that i looked just like a clown due to the big cowl neck and how large and round the dress made me look. if i wasn\\'t so disappointed, i might have laughed. this had to have been a design mistake. i\\'ve truly never seen something so unflattering. I ordered a size up after reading the reviews, but i wouldn\\'t of had to. it\\'s not a snug fit at all. although, i am fairly small busted. soft fabric with a little stretch that will be great for lounging around the house or running errands. So incredibly comfortable.  the sweater wasn\\'t flattering on me (i\\'m super busty) so i sent it back but it was a tough call because of how incredibly soft. This is a super cute dress which is quite flattering. it is made with a higher waist and a bit of a fit and flare. the only complaint is the side zipper which seems to get caught and not move easily. I am a 34dd so i purchased the small in green, hoping for a more fitted silhouette. i got what i wanted and it looked great overall. except for the chest. it just sort of mashed my chest down in a very unflattering way. but despite all that i almost kept the coat because it was so soft and warm and beautiful. and sturdy! i could have sized up for a better fit in the chest but then it would have been boxy and we hourglass shaped ladies know how poorly that works out. wish this would have worked b I wanted to love this product so badly. i ordered it in the mail, and it looked beautiful coming out of the box. i normally look really nice in grey, but this color really washed me out and was not nice on. the fabric is very sheer, so you would have to wear it over a camisole/tank top. this is one of those pieces that looks better on the hanger than in person. large in arms, small on body. odd fit. This is a basic henley, and it is made well; a wardrobe staple, for sure. the cut is flattering, and the material is soft. i ordered the small, which is tight fitting. i\\'m a 34 c for reference. This sweater was a big let down. i am 5\\'2\" so i ordered it in a petite. it was so short that if i lifted my arms, you\\'d see my bra!! there is no way i could wear it without something under it- even with high waisted bottoms. and the bell sleeves look nothing like the pic. the entire sleeve is just wide, and it continues with little increase into the cuff. it is just short and boxy. it is going back for sure. I love these. the color and the style. but they are once again too short. they are not 33 inches. i need 32 inches to go to the floor. these are above the floor so they are not 33 inches. very disappointing. Love this dressed up casual tshirt. perfect casual friday shirt or going out for happy hour with the girls. This top is perfect for the first day at clown college if you want to see some clowns cry. the sleeves are probably the worst part of this overpriced monstrosity. the elastic at the cuffs makes the already comically large sleeves billow and puff out even more. \\r\\n\\r\\nbuy this if you enjoy walking to the post office to return things. The fabric of this skirt is absolutely beautiful. however the fit, albeit unique, is not extremely flattering in my opinion. it may be because i am somewhat of a pear/hourglass shape rather than a more straight shape, but the fit is a little off imo. i am 5\\'8\" and 135# and ordered both the 6 & 8 and felt the 8 fit a little better. Purchased because i wanted a deep red sweater, and this one was the perfect color. unfortunately i am on the curvier side, with 34g chest, 155lbs 5\\' 5\", and the med was too big, (i usually wear m or l at retailer.) also the fit ended up being boxy on my body type. At 5\\'4\", i guess i am just too short to pull this dress off! the colors are so pretty for summer, but there is just too much fabric... i felt like i was wearing a giant doily! however, there is not a doubt in my mind that taller girls would look fabulous in this! I bought the red and it is gorgeous. i love how it hangs - heavy but fluid. i usually wear a 4 but i bought a 6 and it was perfect. This one will be going back. the color is really blah and the fabric wasn\\'t a texture i was expecting--it is kind of thick and ribbed and i suspect it would stretch out over the course of the day. overall, the cut and style is cute, but i just felt like i was wearing a hospital gown with the combination of the fabric and the style. this may have been cute in a more vibrant color and lighter weight fabric. I was looking for a simplistic dress because i am graduating in a few weeks but did not really want to purchase anything. i strolled in the store and this immediately caught my eye. i tried it on and fell in love!! it fits perfectly and it is the right length. i love the bust line and the detailing of the straps in the back. i don\\'t think i feel as though i am going to a wedding,but i will feel beautiful especially since this is really big deal and accomplishment. i am an older adult - so i want First off, this shirt is a hd in paris brand, not floreat. i love floreat clothing so that is why i initially bought this blouse. i like the idea and the coloring of the shirt. the biggest drawback for me was that it is completely see through. i just bring myself to get a strapless cami just to wear this one top. please change brand name. I love this dress. the fit is great for tall girls i\\'m 5 9\\' and the length is perfect. can be dressed down with cute sneakers or up with heels. every time i wear this dress i get a ton of compliments and it is so comfortable. I keep trying to find a peplum that works for me, but so far i have been unsuccessful. i just do not think that my shape and the peplum shape play well together?aside from the peplum issue, this shirt had a massive amount of material and runs large. the material alone is thick, making it a bulkier shirt, then add the volume of the peplum and i looked (and felt) huge. needless to say, this one was returned, sale or no sale. This didn\\'t work for me. im normally a m (8/10). got this in xs. that was the correct size for me, i believe. however, the armholes were huge. husband said the top of the dress looked like the autobots symbol from transformers and he wanted me to keep it. but, i sent it back. I just ordered this dress in blue on sale and it was such a bargain for the quality and look. it\\'s a very comfortable dress that swings and flatters my body type, which is tall and thin. i think this dress would not work on a more busty woman\\'s frame, but it definitely works for me. i\\'m 5\\'9 and 135 pounds and a small is plenty big (i often take a medium). i definitely recommend this dress. I am returning the dress. it has too much volume and is not flattering at all Very good quality. love the length of it. i wore it with a belt, since on me without it looked a bit too big. i bought the blue one. I didn\\'t have any problems with the fit, i love the puffin pattern, the material is nice---it\\'s just so short. i really haven\\'t decided if the print is worth the awkwardness of the length, or if i\\'ll just keep it and only wear it when it\\'s cool enough outside to wear a tank under it, so i can avoid flashing my stomach every time i lift my arms. but, yeah...it stops right at my waist in front. way too short--stop making these great shirts so short, please. This fell apart after wearing it once. for the price, it should hold up better. it\\'s too delicate. I\\'m undecided about this shirt. this design is absolutely beautiful. but the shirt is very very sheer and the front comes down so low in a curved hem line. so, when you wear the necessary base layer, the shirt extends several inches beyond that and it looks kind of odd. i really wish tiny would make some beautiful shirts like this that aren\\'t sheer and have a shorter front. i purchased my regular size and it fits a little smaller than other tiny shirts i have purchased. since the shirt is so bea Ugh! i am not sure how anyone is giving this good reviews. i tried small, medium and large on and huge huge huge, boxy, fabric bunched at the shoulders and did i mention it\\'s way too boxy? the fabric and pattern are so pretty but the fit is just awful. i would try this one on before purchasing. Love the block appearance. looks exactly like on the model ! material again could have been better. dry clean only, so expensive wear. price per wear may be high due to that as each time you dry clean price actually goes up and use goes down. Got this in the petite xs in mint; the color is gorgeous, it\\'s a really bright mint that complements my super fair skin really well (though it would work for pretty much any skin tone). it\\'s still a good length in the petite for the type of shirt it is (5\\'1 and hits right around my lower hips). it is a thinner fabric, but that\\'s what i was expecting, and the lace detailing at the bottom of the sleeves is a nice touch and makes it more than just a plain henley. So disappointed! beautiful dress in the photographs but the cut was incredibly strange. loose and baggy through the top and mid-section but tight around the buttock and thighs. This dress first caught my eye online. due to the price i resisted. then i saw in store and tried on...i decided to hold off for a sale, but my will was getting thin. once i saw it start to sell out online, i had to take the plunge. i knew this dress was a must have. it is super flattering and comfy! the best of both worlds. i\\'m small-chested so both the s and m fit, but the seam on the s fit a bit higher, which was more flattering on me, so s is what i got. it can be dressed up or slightly down After trying several one piece options i decided to buy this gorgeous tankini. i love the fit - bottoms stay put while running around the beach with my girls, but still stylish. the top is a perfect fit- little lining and halter adjustable tie is flattering on a smaller chest. the material is high quality and i will be living in this all summer long. there is about a two inch gap between the top and bottom. This top is beautiful in design, but sadly, i will be returning. it is hand wash, and even after doing so, i had 2 unraveled threads resulting in large holes. unfortunate since it was so flattering before washing. This dress is way prettier in person than online. fits like a glove. a little tight up top as are most side zips. i did not have to size up, however. I was really excited about this sweater, but the fit was terrible. the sleeves were the right size, but the body of the sweater was a tent - absolutely no shape. they must have clipped the sweater on the model. for reference, i\\'m 5\\'4 and 120 pounds and ordered a size small. This was another unusual choice for a larger busted woman like myself, but i couldn\\'t say no to that sweet little back detail. i\\'ll attack the waist with a cropped jacket. for those looking to add volume or flowy fabric, you\\'ve found your answer and then some! I recently came across this dress in store and decided to try it on. i immediately fell in love. my husband was patiently waiting outside the dressing area to see it and give his opinion but i knew i was going to get it regardless of his thoughts. :) this dress could be worn with heel, flats, sandals, booties, etc. the one drawback i have is the high cut of the wrapover in front. as other reviewers have said, i plan on wearing this places where i won\\'t be sitting for long periods of time because This tunic is very nice. flattering, good design, worn in winter and spring, and fits well. i have a curvy figure, and this fits well. i wish it came in more colors.it does show flaws slightly but fits well and is stretchy. Maybe it\\'s because i\\'m 40, but this top was underwhelming. i felt like it was a cheap tee with a big, obnoxious bow on the back. it does look cute on the model, so maybe it\\'s a \"younger\" top. i would have felt silly wearing it. Fits and lots nothing like picture. very wide like a tent dress! I\\'m glad i bought this dress with a discount. it\\'s a comfortable staple, but not a showstopper. i love the plush fabric, which has great weight, and the skirt. the top is cut to be a little revealing, which worked well with my full bust but wouldn\\'t be work appropriate. the keyhole at the back is large, but did not reveal my bra. This dress is the best of all worlds: sophisticated, modern, and flattering. i was surprised that the \"dress\" is actually two separate pieces: a navy blue slip and a bold magenta lace overlay, which will be perfect going into fall and the holiday season. i had two babies back-to-back and am not back to my pre-baby shape, but i was pleased to see how flattering this dress was. i will be wearing it to a wedding in a couple of weeks, and i know i will feel comfortable and confident in it. I had to return this blouse because it ended up been too small and super itchy. im kind of busty but medium usually works and this one was super tight across my chest. not comfortable at all and the fabric is kind of a sheer with the sparkly lines in silver.\\nwouldn\\'t recommend it. On shopping trips i try to try on at least one thing that i like but don\\'t think will look that great on me. this dress was that item today. not only did i like it, but i liked the way it looked on me. i\\'m 5\\'3\", 140 pounds and purchased the medium. i loved it, the clerks loved it, and my very honest daughter also loved it. i will wear it as a dress and also as a tunic over skinny jeans. I tried this dress on in the store, and nearly bought it. other reviewers commented on the tight chest, but i must admit, this was the one part of the dress that fit like a dream on me. however, i am very small busted (34a). the waist is very flattering, as well. but, the skirt seemed to poof out at the wrong spots (namely, where the pockets are- i love pockets, but not when they create extra bulk at my widest points) and the skirt was about two or three inches longer than i would\\'ve liked. anyt I recently purchased this blouse on their 40% off sale in white. i was hoping for a crisp white structured blouse. i did read all the reviews and thought i would give it a try anyway. it is awful. there is no structure or shape but the quality is the reason i am returning. it feels like a napkin or thinner. not even worth the extra sale price. i will be returning. I ordered the taupe version of this tee, which was a medium brown with black stripes. the fabric felt itchy and rough, and was pretty sheer for not being light colored. i didn\\'t care for the fit, which was extremely boxy and wide; from the picture, i expected an a-line fit, but not a wide drop with webbed underarms. i ordered 2 sizes, and could have worn the smaller if i\\'d kept this tee. it runs on the larger side. what astounded me most was that both tees i ordered were sewn with completely cro I loved this when i saw it online. tried it on in the store, and though it is beautiful, it\\'s a lot of sweater. its a a bit heavy in weight, the buttons on the collar give you the option to wear it up or open as shown in the picture. the problem was that when it was open the big button loop hung down right in front. that was probably the determining factor against purchasing it. if it goes on sale i may reconsider. Cute and comfortable! i loved the colors and how soft the shirt is! I bought this top during the extra 30% off sale, so the price was definitely worth it and i know i\\'ll get a lot of wear out it. i bought the grey and the lace isn\\'t too revealing, but just enough for me to want to wear a cami underneath, especially at work. i\\'m normally a small/4 in retailer brands, but i bought a xs and it fits great, so it does run a little large. It\\'s a fine dress, but it definitely runs small, and it\\'s actually a lot shorter than i was expecting, especially since i\\'m only 5\\' 3\" This top is quite boxy and i was very disappointed with the color, it looked as if i\\'d washed it in filthy water. it\\'s a very dingy white, needless to say it went back. I was in love with this suit from the pictures. unfortunately the top is a little too short so the peplum skirt hits right at my widest part and doesn\\'t meet the bikini bottoms. I fell in love with this top online. i am obsessed with the little flounce detail on the sleeve and the slight a-line shape of the body. i was able to try it on in store and was glad i did because i ended up sizing up to a small from my usually x-small. i still put \"true to size\" because i think the forgiving cut allows the top to work in multiple sizes. i even tried on a medium and it still looked like it fit. the arms are a bit tight, as the other reviewer mentioned so keep in mind when choosi This skirt is great for anyone who wants to highlight a defined waistline, but may want to skim over a few lumps and bumps. the skirt has a nice, wide waistband that hugs tight at the middle and pleats that give a little flare without being too much.\\n\\nthe fabric is nice and thick and the skirt is lined.\\n\\ni am looking forward to wearing it to the office with a fitted dark top and heels. I was so sad not to love this dress. it is beautiful, but is so unflattering on. there is a lot of material under the arms and it gathers up due to the smocking. so, it just made me look incredibly frumpy. i don\\'t really think a petite would have helped - the gathers just bunch a bit and so rather than hang, the dress sort of clumps. i am lean but broad shouldered and maybe that is the problem, but i was super disappointed. narrow shouldered people with long torsos could pull this off. it is a t Material is thin, with a fleece like feeling on the inside. hard to describe but almost feels like a really thin north face material. the cut on the sides of chest area is super awkward, shows way too much, would never be appropriate to wear a regular bra underneath. I tried this on in the store and i couldn\\'t keep it on my body for more then 30 seconds. it\\'s extremely itchy, which is a pity, because i do appreciate the design. :( This dress is really cute in person. however, it did not fit me like it does the model in the pic at all. first of all i\\'m 5 feet 1 and it was wayyy too short on me. i didn\\'t have the petit on either-- i had the regular xs. it just hits a couple of inches too short for me. i am 50. it would be adorable if i were more comfortable in shorter dresses. i wear short things a lot, but this was just too high on me. it was probably a good 8 inches above my knee. also it flared too dramatically at the wa Super cute sweater and i was totally excited and then i looked at the sleeves (which are not shown in the pictures). what you can not see are the dragonfly (sequins and sparkly beads suitable for women 4 and 84). ugh. too bad - going right back. As with other maeve dresses, the fit is great. i love the empire waist with stud details. the slip is nice and stretchy and i really like the flowy chiffon look over a fitted slip. i\\'m not too keen on the way the sleeves tie and find that the ties get in the way of everything. when i first saw this online, i was super excited to find it in the stores because i loved the big orange snake that is on the back of the dress shown online. however, only the smallest size had the great snake on the back What i love especially about this dress are the comfortable, soft fabric and the shape of the back -- the scoop and longer back hem are very ballet dancer! the green & off white print is very pretty for spring. sizing is a little tricky for me as i\\'m between petite and regular sizes. the hem length in the sp is perfect, about 1.5\" above the knee in front, but the waist sits a little high. the top seam of the waist section is above my natural waist, and the bottom seam sits right under my navel s I ordered this to arrive at my store and was so excited to try it on. it was soft and cuddly, but a little baggy under the arms, and it shed everywhere. underwhelmed. I had been eyeballing this for a very long time because i loved the look of the skirt and this top (of which i snagged the skirt when it went on sale). i was delighted to finally take a chance and buy this when it went on sale, too. thoughts below:\\r\\n______\\r\\npros:\\r\\n- it is well made and on the thicker side. \\r\\n- for a peplum, it is actually slimming. i am an hourglass and with hips, which usually means such tops flare out so much making me look wider in all the wrong places. so i was skeptical abo I agree with the other reviewer who said she cannot believe it\\'s not flying off the shelf. this looks gorgeous on and the fit is perfect. i ordered my usual size m. i am 5\\'3\" 34dd and it looks amazing. it is breezy and flowing but without the baggy look. it is so cute with jeans or leggings. the fabric is the perfect weight- light but still thick enough that it\\'s comfortable and my light bra is not seen underneath. love this top!!! Color is not like photo and fit doesn\\'t work if you\\'re busty One of the worst shirts i\\'ve tried in a long time. i don\\'t know how they managed to give it a little shape on the model. in person it is sleeveless, huge, short and wide. I have been searching for a comfortable pair of flared jeans to wear with tennis shoes or flats. i have tried several different brands and these are amazing! they are super soft and comfortable with just the right amount of stretch. the coloring is excellent for the casual look i am going for. the pocket detailing is cute and helps to flatter your bottom. i am 5\\'2\" so these were very long but nothing a good seamstress can\\'t fix. i will note that cutting of that much of the bottom will reduce som Like one of the previous reviewers, when my jacket arrived, it was not in the great dark wash pictured online. it was in a basic, medium denim wash. i like the wash pictured online; i did not like the wash the jacket came in. additionally, know that it is just huge. i ordered my usual size (medium) and understood that the jacket was meant to be roomy and swingy, but there is no way that one size down would be enough to compensate for how swimmingly large it was. i never tried an xs, but it was s I absolutely adore this top. the design on the front is super bright and beautifully done, so beware if you do not like bright colored patterns. i normally wear a size medium and bought a large in this shirt because of reading other reviews, i am glad i did so. i have broad shoulders and muscular arms, and i believe a medium would not have fit my arms and shoulders. however, it is a little boxy in the torso area because of the extra material. therefore, i feel a large feels like a medium in the Lots of embellishment, striking magenta color, feels great on, with a flattering neckline that isn\\'t too low. i recommend it! This shirt is beautiful. it is flowy and light, a perfect piece for transitioning from winter to spring. however, do not follow the washing instructions on the tag. it says you can machine wash, tumble dry low, and despite going one step further and washing on my gentle cycle in cold water and drying it on extra low, it came out of the wash so small that a child could barely wear it. it went from being a tunic to an inappropriate crop top i will never wear again. if you do order, please take the I tried this on in my regular size and was able to get it on fine, but the cup portion of the suit was just crazy! with the straps tied tightly around my neck, it was like the cups just flipped out and open. i am a regular b cup, and i don;t think it was sizing (though i did not have the opportunity to try multiple sizes). the cup did not right and, for this reason, would make this absolutely impossible to wear. unfortunate, because the design is so pretty. I bought this sweater to freshen up my fall wardrobe and just love it! adds texture and warmth to every outfit. Just recently purchased and think it\\'s ok for the price. would never pay full on this one & that\\'s from an retailer shopper who\\'s purchased plenty at full price. design is cute but definitely looks like a sleep shirt esp in the lighter color, so-so on construction - the bottom seams pucker slightly, the pockets bunch up weirdly (steaming/laundering don\\'t help) & the shoulders also hunch up oddly. could be because of the thicker fabric sewn to the knit but laundering didn\\'t help that issue either. I was so excited to receive this dress! it even has embroidered loops on the hem of the slip underneath which was such a cute detail. it\\'s very pretty on. that being said, i ordered a size 4 which fit me perfectly (150 lbs) but ladies, i do not mean this in any way but in my personal opinion, my arms are out of shape. not toned and flabby. the sleeves on this dress will not do you any justice. it will make your arms look worse because of the shape of the sleeve. so keep that in consideration if The shirt design is very nice, but it fits very loose. it will not look good if you are heavier as this shirt will make you look wider because of the baggy fit. the sleeves though are fitted and feel a little tight. the material of the sleeves also is very itchy and feels like some wool material. I ordered this top based on the photos. this looked unique and beautiful, plus i\\'ve loved past designs by this brand. i thought this would be nice for summer. there isn\\'t a straight-on view of the front of the top for a reason. the model is turned to the side and there is one black flower that stands out below her chest, away from the border of the rest of the flowers. the flower looks kind of like a bee. i believe she is either wearing a size larger or pulling down the top to mask the problem. It\\'s the inverted invert ... not so obvious at first but then it shrunk and was harder to ingnore. I ordered this item before seeing the july 25th review. i ordered in a s and need an xs. now the xs is sold out unfortunately. my waist measures 27\", hips 32\", and i am 5\\'4\". the material very nice, has elastic for movement and comfort. i would wear this all the time if i had the correct size. it would be cute dressed down or up. This shirt is so small. i am not sure who came up with the sizing but you have to go up several sizes to get a comfortable fit. don\\'t waste your time on this shirt. such a shame, it could have been very cute. I love the color and style of this dress. and i wanted to love it too? sadly the fabric is truly inferior to the retailer brand and definitely not worth the price of the dress. checked it out in store and so glad i did as it would have been returned for sure. I agree with the other reviewer who stated this sweater is very \"80\\'s\"!! online it looks minorly fluffy with muted colors, but in person it\\'s a bad overly-fuzzy christmas sweater with super bright 80\\'s colors!! if you\\'re going for kitschy / tacky / retro this may work for you, but if you are looking for the sweater in the photo you\\'ll be disappointed... :( it looked to be true to size, but to be honest i hated it so much i didn\\'t even try it on. Great pants, like the edginess of the design in the material. kinda rocker like. soft material that\\'s stretchy and hopefully will hold its shape during the day. the color is listed as black but it\\'s more of a dark gray with a slight blue hint. I have been looking for a fall/spring coat to wear when the weather is between 30 and 55 degrees. this \"coat\" looks great in the pictures, but so disappointing in reality. the best thing i can say is that the fabric is soft. it is unlined, so i\\'m not sure why you\\'d even wear it -- if the weather\\'s warm enough to wear a thin, unlined jacket, why not just wear a sweater? the weight is not what i would expect at this price point. even worse, the design is terrible; my husband (who has a great eye) Received this dress, the sleeves are very pretty, the drape was just what i was looking for, but the overall dress was not very flattering on me. i am a little busty on top so it pulled in a unflattering way. i would say that if you are tall and not on the busty side this could be an amazing dress on. this one had to go back I was so excited about this skirt and pairing it with a cute blouse for the warmer weather. as i took out the skirt out of the package and flipped it around, the back has mesh strips that are see through! there is also no lining to go with this skirt. if you go back to the \"back view\" picture on the website and zoom in closely, you can see the model\\'s black underwear. This top is cut too short & wide with too much light material in between. to be truly slimming & flattering, it needs to have more of the rayon/spandex blend, to make it heavier & bouncier. then it would \"hang\" appropriately and \"swing\" and (hopefully) not add pounds to the wearer. unfortunately this top is too lightweight & has too much material. pass. This dress is everything i hoped it would be--bright, colorful, quality jacquard, classic silhouette. unfortunately it runs small up top on the bust and i couldn\\'t even zip it up all the way. returning :( I\\'m returning this cardigan. it doesn\\'t fit me at all. it\\'s shapeless and loose. I ordered the white \"denim\" online and was very disappointed by how thin the material was. i had tried on the light blue denim in the store and it had a nice weight to it. the style is wonderful and the fit is very flattering, but too sheer for me to wear outside the house! After readying the reviews of this dress, i thought for sure i was purchasing a winner. boy, was i wrong! first, this dress feels like a potato sack and looked like one on. i felt that it was very boxy and more of a o\\' one size fits all\\' sizing. it did not embrace my curves at all. the material was not as chic as i would have thought. overall, the entire dress was not flattering. honestly, i do not understand what the rave reviews were talking about it. As you can see, there is an array of differing opinions on here, and i share sentiments on both:\\r\\n_______\\r\\npros:\\r\\n- the texture and feel of this is great; it is very comfortable and is different.\\r\\n- tts for the most part; i normally can wear sizes 10 and 12 (m and l) with most retailer and got the medium and the fit was overall fine but more snug at the hips. if you\\'re more slim/straight, it\\'ll probably fit you like on the model. \\r\\n- good length, not too short or too long.\\r\\n- the mock collar is ni Ugh, i was so disappointed with this shirt. i was so excited when i saw it online and thought it would be a perfect summer shirt with the light colors and the flower print. unfortunately it falls flat and i understand now why they don\\'t have a straight on photo of the shirt, its very plain and lays very unflatteringly. it\\'s definitely missing something in the front. i typically wear a small to an extra small and i ordered this in an extra small and would have needed an xxs if i hadn\\'t returned i Bought this based off the reviews here but this was a miss for me. the colors weren\\'t as vibrant as pictured and the waist in this dress is huge. not flattering and it went back. i buy an retailer dress every week so i just exchanged this one for another one i loved. not hard to do at all I wanted to love these, but they\\'re so tight around the top. my legs are normal size and i couldn\\'t get them above my knee. the top isn\\'t stretchy...it has a string that keeps it from expanding. they are so very cute, but unfortunately must go back for me. I\\'m 5\\'-4\", 130lbs with a 32f chest. this dress looked like a cross between little house on the prairie and a mu mu. i can\\'t imagine this looking good on anyone who isn\\'t 7\\' tall. also, the straight across, rather high neck line wasn\\'t flattering to a large chest and then the arm holes are huge. the fabric was a bit shiny and felt cheap. it wasn\\'t see through but it had the feel of a nightgown, not a hundred dollar dress. My conscience screamed at me not to buy this sweater and i wish i had listened! i noted the fact that it was acrylic and also the fact that it was oversized. but i also loved the design and can\\'t resist anything with mustard yellow. i was instantly disappointed when i received it, almost didn\\'t even try it on. how can they possibly charge $185 for terrible itchy 80\\'s acrylic? it looks cheap, it feels cheap and it didn\\'t even fit well. only redeeming quality: easily returnable! I just received this dress wadded up in a bag. it is nothing like the colors shown on line. in the picture it appears blue and white. in actuality it is teal and a funky color of beigey pink. the top is see though but it does see have a slip under the skirt. will be sending it back and again remind myself why i shouldn\\'t try to buy a dress on line. I\\'ve been wearing this very comfortable and cute coat for 2 weeks. it is already tearing at the seams somehow. the quality of this is very poor. The shirt cuts too high up and is very awkward looking on. sent it back. wouldn\\'t buy even on sale. I love this dress - the fabric is super soft, and it falls beautifully! wish it was lined, but it\\'s a keeper. it does run big - i\\'m always a solid medium, and i had to go down to a small for this one (but who\\'s complaining!). the burgundy color is gorgeous! i\\'m 5\\'4 150 lbs, a size 8 (m) almost always. This would be perfect except for the ridiculous attached scarf. the material is so soft and luxe. the colors are richer in person and perfectly go with everything. but the attached scarf ruins everything!! the scarf is not flattering and takes away form the cute buttons on the front. if the scarf could be removed it would be a great sweater coat. so disappointing. Do not buy this dress for full price. the design looks great but after receiving the dress, the material is made of extremely cheap slinky-ish polyester that you would find at a f21 store. the stitching is horrific and created an uneven \"hump\" on the back seam. just absolutely poor poor quality. I ordered this in a large and its a super cute dress but this time the large ran super big! i usually wear a 10 so sometimes mediums are too small. i\\'m going to exchange it for a medium and see if that fits better. the beading detail is beautiful but just had too much fabric down below. I cannot believe this t-shirt is on sale! the colors and the design are beautiful and soft. the shirt is an average t-shirt weight, and the fit is nice and loose on the body like it is on the models. i am 5\\'3\" with a petite/athletic build and the xs fits comfortably (with some room...washing may make it even more perfect). i cannot wait to wear this with jeans on the weekends or with a grey skirt to work. Very cute on, fits well. versatile top, i think it will work well with a sweater or blazer for fall. Love this top! so soft and sweet! only complaint is that it\\'s a bit short and a tad boxy for my 5\\'9\" 140#  frame (i also have boobs, so that doesn\\'t help the fit of this piece).  going to tuck in the front into high waisted jeans! keeping it! The description doesn\\'t indicate the metallic thread throughout the design. you cannot tell from the pix either. it\\'s also a really strange design with the arm holes being almost the entire length of the sweater. can\\'t decide if i want to keep it or return it. Let me start by saying i am incredibly picky about pants. i hate probably 99% of the pants i try on. pilcro is the consistent exception, and these are probably my favorites of all my pilcros (perhaps tied with the cords). runs true to pilcro size, which i find to be a bit large--most of my other pants are a 30, and a 29 is quite comfortable in these. despite being leggings, they\\'re thick/structured enough to wear to work. I\\'m barely 5\\'4\" and rarely find a maxi that isn\\'t far too long or the other extreme. i prefer mine to just barely reach the ground as opposed to rising 5 inches from the floor for example. this one is perfect with flat sandals. i tried on the 4 and chuckled b/c it was 6\" too long. tried on the 2 and not only was it the perfect length, the bodice fit like a glove. i would say i\\'m average bust size, always fluctuating but not generally flat-chested. i prefer more conservative sleeveless dresses an I just purchased these pants in red on sale. i am 5/5\", 143 pounds, and the 10 fit perfectly (i am either an 8 or a 10 in pants, depending upon brand). it is really hard for me to find pants that are cute, unique, work-appropriate, and flattering. these pants fit the bill in all aspects. i thought i would prefer the black, but am really glad i got the red. I really like the color and flow of this dress. the dress itself fit well however the slip was extremely tight through the bust. i have a large bust at 34d however most dresses are still wearable especially flowy dresses. unfortunately i had to return this one because of the slip. I loved this dress from the moment i tried it on. so flattering to my postpartum body without being a huge tent. soft fabric, and for a white/lightly striped dress, not sheer. i\\'m bummed because after washing only twice (followed the instructions to wash) on gentle cycle and low tumble dry, holes started appearing everywhere, both on the cream ribbed hem in the front bottom and all across the chest, in the white part of the fabric only (it looks like the black stripes are holding the holes toget Very pretty top, but like the other reviewers said?the neck is very itchy. i live in florida and i don\\'t think i can wear this during the summer unless i get the neck lined. i got an xxs p which was a little shorter than i would have liked, so i am returning for xxs. This dress is amazing ! the colors in person are so vibrant and yet organic somehow at the same time. perhaps this is because the fabric has a really nice depth and texture to it. i got this dress for a summer wedding and it\\'s casual yet dressy at the same time. \\r\\n\\r\\nre: fit - the best thing about this dress - is a fit ! it\\'s so incredibly flattering on, it fits like a glove. it just hugs your figure in the most flattering way, especially if you have an hourglass figure. the fit is true to size - I really loved this vest online and decided to try it on in store. it was really cute on and fit nicely so i purchased it (in my normal size) and took it on a vacation. first time wearing it and the color transferred all over my white shirt even though it says it is pre-washed. i am very disappointed considering how expensive this was. overall, it is very cute but it may ruin your clothes so beware! I loved this dress the moment i saw it online and debated ordering it as i wasn\\'t sure the color would work on my pale skin, but wow, so pretty! it fits like s glove, in fact i almost had a hard time zipping the side where the fabric changes. the tie waist in a beautiful addition. the chest seems roomy enough, i am a 30 dd and the 0 petite fit. it is surplice so may give more if bigger chested. the skirt is a kind of lace and looks pleated at the same time. my only complaint is the side zipper i Quality was not what you expect from retailer, especially for the price. top is lined but skirt is not. material is tissue paper thin and see thru. there is a point at the bottom of the sweetheart neckline that does not lay flat, it keeps popping up. however the back is very cute and for that i wanted to love it but too many negatives. was returned. It fits super baggy everywhere and looked sloppy on me. I sized up to an xl and although they have everything you want in a yoga/lounge pant, they just didn\\'t thrill me enough to keep them. they\\'re soft, warm and comfy but i didn\\'t care for the bulk or fit of the foldover waistband. and they were too long so i returned. if you\\'re built like the model, you\\'ll love these. I saw this top on a store mannikin and was drawn to it by it\\'s color and print. it looked great with blue jeans on display and a lariat necklace. then i noticed the different design on the back below the yoke. the surprise was its being pleated into very fine pleats. i liked the funky quality this added. the design is a good transitional piece to wear early fall or under a jacket. it is machine washable and that finalized the purchase of it. i bought the necklace too. i often wear a small but go I wanted to wear this for my journey to cuncun and i wanted the blight pink as photo however it was a dark pink which didn\\'t fit to me unfortunately... but the design was pretty! I snagged this the first day i wore it with my wedding ring. it is very delicate and i can\\'t wear it when i\\'m with my kids because they pull on it so much! it will just me by night out wrap i guess!!! I wanted a comfortable and loose casual dress. i liked the pictures and decided to give it a try.\\r\\nthe dress turned out to be too loose (i got size 4 after checking the measurements chart, i\\'m 5\\'7\\' 125 lb and usually wear s). i could practically wrap myself in this dress. besides, it looks a bit too long (well, i\\'m not as tall as the model in the photos and i don\\'t like wearing high heels).\\r\\nthe material looks faded, not as bright as in the pictures. i like distressed and vintage style, but this Love the style of this shirt. its flattering and light material, good for all weather and layering. I ordered my normal size 6 in this dress and could barely get it on. it runs very small. i would suggest going up a size or maybe even two sizes up. I washed and dried this in my dryer after one wear and it shrunk to the size of a toddler shirt. i dried it on medium. i can not really wear it unless i want to show off my belly. i loved the color (lilac). fit, and style when i received it and immediately put it on. so sad about the shrinkage. for a $58 shirt i expected a bit more. retailer should suggest air drying the shirt. so bummed and disappointed!!!! i would not recommend this shirt unless you can remember to air dry it every time. I was so excited to finally find a work appropriate contemporary pant that i wore them about 3 times in the first week. needless to say they needed to be washed, and i followed the care instructions by washing in cold water and laying flat to dry. after just a single wash in cold water, the pants faded to the point that they looked like they were three years old. so sad, luckily retailer took them back without a problem. be warned, these may need to be dry cleaned which is a lot of maintena Way too long...the sizing is incredibly off on this product. order a size or two down. I agree with the other viewers that this cardigan is significantly better looking in person. i am 5\\'7\" 126 lbs and bought the medium. it is more fitted than how it is on the model. it keeps its shape after multiple wears and is very comfortable. i\\'m glad i have it! This is a beautifully made dress and i couldn\\'t wait to put it on. i was disappointed. i am 5\\'5\" and a size 4- 6. i ordered the 6 and it was too \\'long and heavy\\' looking on me. but the waist and upper body fit tightly. the zipper up the back was very heavy looking and the cut away shoulders didn\\'t work for my body type, making me look bulky on top. the torso is really built for someone with small breasts - i am average and the way the darts are, made my breasts look flatter and lower than they a Beautiful dress, but has an unflattering fit. i purchased an xs and it\\'s past my knees and the bottom of the dress is so heavy! would be a perfect maternity dress though! I love the colors, the material, the design details (especially the white pattern at the end of the sleeves). the sweater is super soft and cosy. i got it in s because i wanted it to be nicely fitted. i am on tops between s and m. i am of tall , narrow build and athletic, which means i have well developed but still slim muscles in my chest, arms and shoulders. to accomadate that i often need m even though the rest of me is an s ;). anyhow, i was a bit surprised. in s the sweater fits very snug i Like the previous review said, i was excited to receive this top. i had grand visions of all the ways i could wear it! to my chagrin, when i put it on, it just fell right down and pooled around my waist. i wish there were smaller sizes to order. sadly, this is going back. I love the color blocking but dress hangs a little strange on me. love the pockets, thought about sending it back and decided it is very comfortable, i will wear it but not quite what i was hoping for. Purchased this in white specifically because i loved the back detail-- (i don\\'t know why most designers overlook the back??). huge disappointment-- the back is totally plain, not at all like the picture of the white top on here and the fabric in the back isn\\'t even the same material as the front. it\\'s almost as if the back is made out of leftover lining from another garment. it was a very sad return! i usually love this brand, this was just a quality control oversight i guess. Skirt in med fit fine, cute,lightweight, swingy, flirty, fun, almost knee length\\ni am typically a 10-12\\nbut the pattern which swings up, across, and down made me look wide in the hips as opposed to other clothes i own already\\nmore petite, less curvy girls enjoy!\\nits going back,sorry! Woah, these jeans looked ridiculous on me. i felt as though it was 1987 and i was raiding my mom\\'s closet. the combination of the light wash, the crop leg and high waist with the odd stitching around the midsection make this a no. it really accentuates any pouch you may have. i was looking for a high waisted denim but these are very unflattering. i am 5\\'3\" / 140 curvy. no, no, no! This dress is horrible. i can\\'t believe they can get away with calling it a \"dress\". it should have been called a tunic or shirt. it looks like it is a soft flowing dress made out of nice material from the pictures, no way. it is made from sweatshirt material it is lifeless and is kind of stiff. it came to the top of my thighs. i can\\'t find one nice thing to say about this dress and i do not recommend it. the picture does it so much more justice that it is worth. This is a great dress that i wear to work, but would also wear to a cocktail party or wedding. it rides up a tiny but, but is long enough that i feel completely comfortable. it is tiny up top so i\\'d recommend ordering up if you have any chest - i\\'m 5\\'4\", 100lbs, bra size 32b and it was a two-person job to get the bodice zipped. I bought this shirt at the store and after going home and trying it on, i promptly went online and ordered two more! i\\'ve gotten multiple compliments anytime i wear any of them. great for looking put together with no fuss. \\r\\npeople that have commented there\\'s were destroyed in the wash didn\\'t read the care label which says dry clean. I wanted to comment about the wash. yes, these jeans look really ?dirty? when you\\r\\npull them out of the package. but after a few months of washing, the dirty color has really\\r\\nmellowed. also, i am a usual 26 in jeans, purchased these in 25 and could have fit into \\r\\nthe 24. i may purchase another pair, these jeans are really unique, comfortable, great \\r\\nfor the summer with sandals or converse. This top is gorgeous in both detail in color. it fit great and true to size, but then i hand washed it as instructed on the label and it shrank substantially to the point that it\\'s now too short and needs to be returned. This top was very cute but super short- and i am a short waisted petitie person-the waistline hits above your belly button- looks very silly. These pants fit comfortably and are really nice on! they\\'re not too bulky and can be worn in a casual way and/or with a formal look. i just wish black jeans didn\\'t always have that odd rubber smell. other than that, these are great! Love this sweater! the abstract floral design adds an understated romantic touch, the red is a beautiful rich red, and the cotton is super soft and comfy. i\\'ve tried it on with pencil skirts and jeans, and it looks great with both. i\\'m considering buying it in the off white too, but it does have some cons. one is the waist band hits me where it does on the model and if you look closely you can see where the sweater poof out over the band a bit--it does that on me too, unless i turn the band up t I was swayed to buy this via the reviews on the site -- and they are all correct! it is a beautiful piece. i got the \"brown\" colored one, but it is pretty much exactly the color in the picture, more of a khaki. \\r\\n\\r\\nit is a gorgeous sweater. the sleeves are very long, but easy to push up if they\\'re too much for you. it is also very long, which i prefer but on shorter gals it may be overwhelming. it\\'s a perfect shell for cooler summer nights and it dresses up a basic outfit. I was extremely disappointed with the quality of this product. as soon as i put this tunic, the right tie loop detached from the garment. i could return it but the point of shopping online was to avoid the hassle of going to the store. the price of the item does not justify the low quality of the final product. I wish i had read the other review about the color of the pink version of this sweater before i ordered it. she was absolutely right - the color is completely different in person. it is this garish pink and brown that looks like it was knit together with remaindered yarn. it\\'s too bad, because the cut of the sweater is cute and the zipper adds a funky touch. maybe the blue is better in person... I wanted to really love this because it\\'s a bit more styled than a plain tank, but the front and back both poof out and i felt like i was wearing a maternity top. just didn\\'t do my body any justice....loved the top and that part fit great, but the bottom part was too poofy and sadly not a good look at all on me. I found this piece very boxy and not very feminine. i tried to make it work but i just wasn\\'t feeling it the material is thin and the design is boring. unfort, it wasn\\'t for me. This is such an incredible jacket. total show stopper and well worth the investment. I saw this dress online and really wanted to love it... unfortunately it wasn\\'t at all as expected in person.\\n\\nas the previous reviewer mentioned it is extremely itchy material, which was already pilling on many of the dresses displayed in the store. the neck was extremely tight; a problem i\\'ve never encountered with any retailer dress. additionally it seems to have a kangaroo pocket located right underneath the bust line, which protruded in an unflattering way. the pocket is not at all not The fit on this is so strange. the middle string is definitely too long and the thin halter top offers hardly any lift. the print is lovely and the quality nice for the price. the cups are padded, which is nice i suppose, but would barely cover anything bigger than a c cup i\\'m guessing. i\\'m a 32dd, size 8 in pants, and size 4/6 in dresses and i ordered a medium. i also have a long torso, which probably didn\\'t help. I like this top. in the photo, the white in the print stands out. in-person, the white areas of the print (not embroidery) is dull, more like beige. the flowers and embroidery itself looks good, the print looks good. it is a swing top, looks better on a slender frame. such loose fitting tops just don\\'t look good on my curvy frame. i sized down, could have tried 2 sizes down but the shoulder area was more fitted. i recommend the top for a more slender frame or if you like very loose fitting tops. The shirt is mostly a thick sweatshirt material and is very short when trying on - undershirt required to make up for length and the see through mesh in the pattern.  felt about 1 size too small as well This skirt is of the highest quality. the fabric and cut is that of a much higher priced item. the fabric at the seams matches!!! no one mentions any longer when fabric seams are mismatched as if that is nonconsequential. to me it means the difference between good and great. this skirt is great except for the sizing. as other reviewers have mentioned....it runs so small. i wear a size 6 skirt. could not zip the 6. ordered the 8 - it zips yet puckers and while it could work - i\\'d be exhausted fro If you\\'re looking for pretty and flowy, this is it! i frequently wear xs in retailer sizing, but in this top i went with a s. 5\\'4\", 123lbs, 34a. love the top but debating on keeping it because i\\'m not sure the yellow color looks great on my slightly olive skin....great with legging capris for summer I love this dress. the colors are eye catching. if flows nicely. Fit is \"breezy\" which is what i expected. a little on the loose side but comfortable and still cute. the slip that accompanies the dress is of decent quality as well.  the back of the dress is not that much longer than the front, as in the picture, but i still liked the dress enough to keep it. Very pretty top. the fabric is wonderful! i enjoy the movement and the style. only downside is that it is cut a little low for me. but it does look great and the fit is, otherwise, perfect Ladies this top shrinks!!! i am very disappointed, i was in love with this top and the first time i washed it it shrunk a significant amount. i did not use a dryer, i laid this piece out to dry as i do with the majority of my knit tops and it shrunk. it is a lot shorter and much tighter, especially in my arms. if you love this top i might suggest buying a size up and washing it to fit. I love the design, that\\'s why i\\'m going back for a smaller size. i bought a medium and that size was made for someone 50 lbs heavier than i. usually i\\'m good at choosing my size online, but not today. if you are curvy and round like me still go for a smaller size because this dress has a lot if room. also i wish more clothes would come into the stores to try on, please! These pants were wonderful...for 2 seasons. yes, for almost $200 a pop they don\\'t even last a full year! loved them so much, i bit the bullet & bought 4 pair. all 4 started to rip in the same spot! i tried to contact ag directly & they do not back up their products after 30 days. fortunately, retailer was wonderful (as always!) i will buy pilcro from now on - much better product for the money. The pink version of this top finally arrived -- nearly 2 months after ordering.  the expected delivery date kept slipping.  the color is not as shown online.  online it looks like a light pink.  the actual top was more of taupe color.  it\\'s a basic tee with pretty ruffling at the bottom.  not enough to keep. I only tried on the ivory one, but it was so see-through, there was just no way. i can\\'t speak for the other colors. seemed true to size, maybe a little large, but that\\'s the style. very cute design, loved the back. too bad. I paid full price for these gladly (the olive ones) and was delighted when i was able to purchase the black on sale. they are midweight, soft, flattering and stylish. they stretch a little (belt needed) but not much. pilcro are my go-to pants and these hit it out of the park. i wish they would come in a lighter weight version for warmer weather ! I love this shirt so i bought both colors. i wish they had more colors! fits great and very comfy. This feels so nice and light and summery. nothing like a crisp white top for the season. I love these shorts, nice material, good fitting, and great look. i sized up, usually an 8 and i ordered a 10 based on others reviews and it was the right choice. these are a great casual short or dressed up with shoes and a nice shirt. If you look closely at the photos, the buttons are only shown as applied halfway down the placket but the buttons run the entire length of this fabulous sweater by moth. the sweater fits tts; i am 5\\'5\" 142 lbs and the m is just perfect with room to wear more than an average tight fitting tee underneath. it is a mid-weight nylon-viscose-cashmere knit with understated black cotton \\'rope\\' snails on the pockets. there\\'s nothing boring about it as is often the case with long-sleeved, navy blue cardig I have mixed feelings on these. i ordered the honey which is a mustard color as shown in the picture. they are true to size, cute, and comfortable. i washed them the first time with a load of darks and the color ran onto other clothes. plus the pants looked a little streaked in some areas. i\\'m not sure if this was a bad lot, but back to the store they went. I love the style of this dress and the way it lays. looks nice on, just wish it were longer. i normally wear size small but had to return for a medium so that it was long enough. Really wanted to love, the top was very flattering and loved the material: very swingy and forgiving. but way to much material, i was drowning in it. sized down to x small but no go. Absolutely love the print and quality is great too! unfortunately, for a well endowed woman like myself, it runs terribly small in the bust and hip region. it absolutely does not look as flowy on an hourglass body type. too bad because it\\'s beautiful! might try sizing up but doubt it will work :( Great spring colors that you really can wear just about any time of year with the right foot wear! the fabric is a fluid jersey that drapes well. the neck line is a substantial scoop which is very flattering. i am very happy with this online purchase! I was so excited when i ordered this, i love comfy clothing this looked perfect! when i received it, there was a weird smell with the top. convinced that this could be from storage or something, i washed it. the smell did not go away. i have washed it 3 times now and the smell will not disappear! i have not yet worn but as i have washed it, not able to return it. the top looks and feels great - just the weird smell. now i am \\'stuck\\'!! I was so excited to wear this shirt, even after reading the review that it curls up i decided to give this shirt a shot, and i found that the same thing happened to me. it also clings tightly to the body. i would not recommend this shirt for anyone with broad shoulders. This shirt is unflattering and boxy. it does not look cute at all on me. i am returning. I have a love-hate relationship with this dress. the fabric and print are beautiful but like most swing styles, this dress doesn\\'t work if you\\'re curvy. tried on an xs in the store which was huge, ordered an xxsp, the length was perfect but the dress does nothing for a pear-shape. looks marginally better cinched in with the belt but i was lost in all the fabric and the skimming nature of the dress did nothing for me. as my boyfriend said, \"that looks like something you\\'d wear if you were pregnan I consider this to be a flattering dress that is a good wardrobe staple since it can be dressed up or down and worn with a variety items (i.e. cropped denim jacket, oversized knit cardi, leather moto.) the twisty knot in the front is very cute and slimming and doesn\\'t add bulk to my squishy squarish waist. this dress is tts to a bit large. the colors and material make this appropriate for autumn through spring. my only upset with this dress is the raw edges which cheapens the quality and makes m I really loved this skirt on the model, but it just wasn\\'t flattering when i received my order. i ordered two sizes - 2 and 4. i am 5\\'4, athletic build and the front closure made my waist look much larger than it is. the back of the skirt also flared out more than i expected it to. \\r\\n\\r\\nsadly, i had to return both. perhaps this would look better on someone with a much taller frame. The color is more like bluish-green, very elegant! it\\'s very soft and feels great on skin. i love the buttons on the back, it\\'s such a great touch and brings this sweater to a whole new level. \\r\\ni usually wear xs but because i\\'m going to wear this sweater with a button up shirt underneath, i ordered s. great investment! love to have it in my closet. Cute blouse & great price !! I was so excited when i purchased this top! it was going to be my go to for running around, as it looked super cute with leggings and boots! the softness alone made me feel like i was wearing my pajamas.....so comfy! that all changed after one washing......it is now pilling and not nearly as soft as before! makes me sad, but it is going back! I really wanted to love this sweater however it fell much shorter on my 5\\'10\" frame than it falls on the model, between my belly button and hip, and the sleeves ended just below my elbow and were much more voluminous than they appear in the product shot. i do have long monkey arms though, so on someone more petite it would probably fit more like the model shot.\\r\\nthe quality of the knit seems nice, however the zipper used is very slim and light weight and got stuck twice just while i was trying i I usually like coats and wraps with high-waisted belts, but this way too high, and the fit was really unflattering. i can see it being chic on a tall, slender person, but it\\'s definitely not right for my short, curvy body. returning it today. If i stopped eating for a couple of months or jumped into a time machine and set the dial for 1990 i would really enjoy this beautifully made delicate blouse. the problem area is evident looking at the photo --the tiny tight fitted gorgeous bodice. i will keep this piece becasue i love it so and the apocolypse is apparently imminent and i have hardly any food in the house. I was so excited to purchase this dress; i love all shades of grey for winter clothing, i love knits, and i have loved other maeve dresses. however, i simply cannot fathom how poorly this is designed--it fits absolutely nothing like it appears to on the model, to the point that i wonder if i might have received a defective dress.\\n\\nfor reference, i am 5\\'5\", slender and small-boned but also curvy (hourglass). my bust is 36 c, hips about 37-38. i normally wear a small in maeve dresses. maybe it\\'s j I have to disagree with earlier reviewers who suggested this top isn\\'t flattering for larger-breasted women. i\\'m breastfeeding, so i currently have dds that are the bane of my existence, and i was very happy with the way this top fit across my chest. i didn\\'t give it a full 5 stars for aesthetic/design only because i wish it were a bit longer. it hit me below my waist, but not below the crotch of my jeans where it hits the model (possibly because she is not burdened by swollen breasts). the shir Pictures don\\'t do this dress justice, color in store is much more vibrant! embroidered flower is more orange/coral colored. also, at certain angles (depending on the lighting) this dress looks navy blue versus black, which i enjoyed. sizing - while i could have gotten away with my usual 8 the side view was too voluminous and somewhat unflattering so i ended up sizing down to a 6 for a more tailored look. Love this chemise. the lace detail is cute, the length of the skirt is longer than many of the night gowns you\\'d find in the cute, not frumpy category, and overall it is super soft and comfortable for lounging and sleeping. bought the large, and i\\'m normally around a size 8-10, between medium and large depending on the cut of the item. the large is slightly on the big size, so the straps move around when i sleep. not a big deal for me, so i kept it. The shirt is mostly a thick sweatshirt material and is very short when trying on - undershirt required to make up for length and the see through mesh in the pattern.  felt about 1 size too small as well This is one of those dresses that looks so cute on the model but doesn\\'t look anything like that in reality. it has no shape and it fits weirdly all over. i am normally a m and i ordered the s and it is massive. I was sooo excited to buy this top and it was such a bummer. this top hangs so poorly and is so droopy under the arms. it\\'s clearly poorly made and the sizing was way off on me. i ordered my usual medium and it was so large and wide that i had to return it. it weirdly fit perfectly in the shoulders and arm length as mediums do for me but was so wide and unflattering for my figure (5\\'8 and athletic). i really wanted to like this top and considered ordering a small to see if it would fit better bu I had such high hopes for this blouse, as it looks totally stunning online. however, it\\'s not as pictured/described in that it is totally sheer and the brand is not floreat, but rather hd in paris. for the price, the quality is just not there...i\\'ve seen comparable shirts at other stores for much less. i returned it without a second thought. I am sooooooo massively disappointed in this purchase. i thought i had found the perfect pant in this style. both more comfortable and more flattering than similar styles in the store. i wanted to wear them every day; received lots of compliments; felt that you could dress up or down; etc. this is where i have to admit that i wore them several times straight from the store before washing. on the second wear, i noticed threads coming out on the seams, but just on one side of one leg. this was irr I loved this blouse when i got it and wore it before washing. it fit really well and was flattering. the only time i laundered it i hand- washed it in cold water and hung it to dry. the blouse shrunk at least a full size and in awkward places. the sleeves are now tight and way too short. the overall length shortened by at least 2 inches. the top is so tight in the bust now that the buttons popped open. i\\'m very disappointed and surprised.i will be returning it as it is unwearable as is. I have never had a purchase go wrong at retailer, which is why i am was not hesitant to spend this much money on the blazer. however, the quality is very poor - it feels like it might fall apart after one clean. also, the buttons where not sewn on properly. i wear an xs and the size was a good fit, but the overall quality was not worth the price (or even close to it). I really love this coat! i usually wear a size 8 but ordered up a size because i just wanted that look. it is a very warm coat, wasn\\'t expecting that! it is very soft and i love it! one problem, it sheds like crazy, bummer. i wore it over a black turtle neck sweater and when i took my coat off it looked like i had a white cat living in my house. my sweater was covered. i\\'m hoping it will shed less as i wear it longer. having said that,, i still love the look and warmth. i will just need to plan I was so excited to get this in the mail... and loved everything about it except for the fact that it was only as long as one inch above my navel! i don\\'t know why it looks like a normal length on the model. im returning it. I agree with the other reviewers - the fabric is beautiful - although i wish they would start making blouses again that didn\\'t require you to wear a cami underneath because of sheerness. i mean for the price shouldn\\'t it be lined or something. when did our expectations on fabric quality get so low. but i knew going in that it would be sheer so i can\\'t really complain too much. plus they are so loosely sewn on that after 20 minutes and only half the buttons undone one fell off. i gave up at that This runs a little big and falls off the shoulders a bit. i didn\\'t like it as much as i had hoped. I was looking for a holiday dress to wear to the nutcracker and what is more appropriate than a tulle skirt?! the tulle lays fairly flat so it\\'s flattering rather than being poufy. the top is a thick material, but not quite sweater material. since the top is warmer, it should be fine for winter even with short sleeves (and a cute cardigan or furry coat#. i\\'m going to sparkle it up a bit with a necklace or belt, but it also looks fine without extra accessories. fits true to size, i\\'m typically a I really wanted to love this shirt. the snowflake and stripe design is really cute, and the fabric is of nice quality. it\\'s a very loose fit, which i would\\'ve been willing to work with, but... as mentioned in previous reviews, the shoulder seam rests in an odd place on your upper arm, and there are little bumps in the fabric on the arms that appear similar to what happens if you leave a shirt on a wire hanger too long. it looks like you have nubby little wings coming out of your arms. not attrac Lovely fabric, color and embellishment but this shirt was so long i can\\'t even imagine wearing it over leggings.  i felt like i was wearing a dress.  there are too many cute tops on the market to bother having this one tailored (i don\\'t buy sewing or ironing).  \\r\\ndisappointed. The photos online make it look like a comfortable, relaxed, lightweight early fall/spring cardigan. when it arrived it looked very wrinkly and there is no \"shimmer\" as far as i can tell. i tried using my steamer to get some of the wrinkles out, but it didn\\'t work. it looks too rumpled and i don\\'t want to wear something that looks like i just rolled out of bed. The fit of this top on me was much more boxy than on the model, maybe the fault of my fuller bust. my usual small definitely didn\\'t reach my hips as it does hers, and appears wider. i\\'m not even sure the v is as deep! again, could be me. but i\\'m keeping the top because it is just so darn comfortable. as for not looking too top-heavy, ill just have to make it work. This style is right up my alley and i was excited to receive it. however, it is seriously overpriced. i ordered the white and the material is thin and see-through. the small was even a bit roomy (5\\'7\", 140lbs, 32dd). going back unfortunately. These jeans are adorable! i\\'m so sad they didn\\'t fit. my legs are bigger than the rest of my body, but i usually have good luck with wide leg pants. if you are looking for wide legs, these are not the jeans for you! This dress had so much potential. looked cute when i received it. put it on & couldn\\'t wait to take it off. it\\'s shapeless, top heavy & just overall unflattering. the material could be cute....on a totally different dress. don\\'t waste your money. In a sea of dresses, this is the one that caught my eye in the whole store. i am a pear shape, and ended up trying both the medium and the large, taking the medium home. it was super flattering on, and was an appropriate length to pair with tights.\\n\\nhere\\'s where the problem happened. i wanted to wear this dress for thanksgiving, i put it on, and as i tightened the drawstring to cinch in the waist - riiiiiiiiiip! the drawstring ripped through the fabric at the waistband. so disappointed. I bought a size small in this dress even though i am usually a large at retailer. it just hung strangely and clung to the unflattering parts of my body but seemed very large. i loved the feel, color (grey) and style of the dress, but i ended up returning it because of the fit. it also requires something under it since it is fairly see-through. Unlike the other reviewer, i found this skirt to run small...very small. i am pear-shaped and always wear a 12 or size 31. the size 12 in this could barely go over my hips and was very snug around the waist. another inch in the zipper would be nice! there is no spandex in this skirt - just cotton - so there isn\\'t any give to the fabric either. i ordered the size 14, which fit like a glove, but i would really like to see if the 16 would be better. embarrassing but i am just worried that with 100% I love this piece, it fits well and is comfortable. you can dress it up or be more casual. i have received many compliments already and it goes with many of my outfits. I love this cover-up. it does feel big when you first put it on, however, you just pull on the strap and tie it to your liking. i am 5\\'2, so this hits a little lower than on the model in the picture, but it does not drag on the floor. this is my new favorite cover-up. now, all i need is the sun! I ordered my usual size 8 but this run huge, i had to exchange for 6 or even size 4. the fabric is nice and airy. it seems to easily wrinkle though. just have to either iron everytime or dry clean i suppose. unique design. Top was featured in an email ad. i love the colors in both tops and bought both plaids. i\\'m 5\\'4\", about 130 lbs, and the medium fits well. it is long in the back, but i like that. if the front were a little longer, i\\'d prefer that, but the length is ok. the colors are definitely cheery and mood-enhancing, very appropriate for this holiday season. I am 5\\'1\" and 120lb with curves and muscles. i am tiny and slim but i have t & a in spades, a 34c and a bubble but. that said. this dress made me look tall and lithe. i took the xs petite because the xs the fringe was too long on the bottom. there is plenty of blouse on the top to accommodate the \"girls\" and you can pull the dress up or down to make it more blousy or more of a fitted column dress, to your preference. it\\'s more of an antique ivory color and beautiful with gold or silver sandals. Love the design of the fabric. i actually bought these in both colors. i gave only 1 star due stitching on the fabric, it\\'s very scratchy. Hahaha..this dress is hilarious! it looks nothing like the image! i am usually a 0/xs, and 4 was the smallest size available, so i ordered it. when i opened it, it felt like 10 lbs of fabric. i thought maybe i ordered a size way too big, until i could barely squeeze into the top of the dress. once i looked in the mirror, i almost fell over laughing. the rest of the dress is huge. i don\\'t believe this dress would be flattering on anyone. I was really excited after finding this top online and reading the reviews; the combination of peplum, cap sleeves, and color seemed too good to be true. i ordered a size medium but unfortunately, this top is on the short side so wearing it with pants or jeans did not work out. in addition, the fabric was more sheer than it looks in the picture and the v-neck in front dipped a little lower, too. a camisole might have solved both of those problems but i didn\\'t bother. i returned it to the store. Very cute dress, but fabric is very flimsy and seams were very puckered which couldn\\'t be pressed out. I put a lot of hopes on this pullover. i needed something for the spring, and it seemed perfect. plus, the sale price is very attractive compared to the regular retailer prices. but... i am not exactly disappointed, but i\\'d say surprised. \\r\\n\\r\\ni would still consider this sweater good for spring. it\\'s thin enough to be tucked into a skirt or pants if you like. the pullover is very stretchy - frankly, i would prefer it to be less stretchy, but that might be a plus for someone more busty. the quality This actually might be my favorite thing that i have ever owned.  the jacket is so beautiful and so cozy jacket. i agree that the pics do not do this amazing piece justice.  for reference, i am 5\\'7 140 lbs and bought the large to allow a bit of room for layering. I love this beautiful summer dress! i am tall (5\\' 10\"), and this dress is a great length on me. sometimes with high/low dresses, the \"high\" is too short, but this dress is perfect. it does run large. i originally ordered a medium, but had to return it for a small. it is very voluminous. my only complaint would be the arm holes are huge. i am going to have to wear a camisole or bandeau top under it, or you can see my bra. I totally agree with the last reviewer. i\\'m 5\\'2\" 115 pounds with somewhat wide shoulders. the x-small fit my torso but was so tight in my shoulders i couldn\\'t move my arms. the small was better but was too big in the torso. the material itself was really nice. too bad the fit was so awkward and unflattering. I wanted to love this dress because the fabric is fun, but i could not find a way to make the drawstring waist look like anything but a potato sack.the model has her hands hiding the lack of a waistline It\\'s relatively light material; even if you layered a sweater over this i can\\'t see it being good for winter. i\\'m in california so it\\'s fine :) length is great - i\\'m 5\"4 and it hits just at the knee. i\\'m a true size 2/small and this fit great, even though i have a curvier figure. pretty classic dress. I fell in love with this trench when i first saw it online but ended up returning it once i tried it on. i\\'m 5\\'9, 140 lbs and the m fit true to size. but the belt hit above my natural waistline and the skirt of the coat was much fuller than i expected, making me look heavier. the material also wrinkles easily and the stitching was poor quality with lots of loose threads. disappointed, as the color and concept were great. The image does not show but the front of the dress has a heavy 24\" utility zipper hidden with 5 snaps. the zipper pull, when closed, sat right on my collarbone, which was he height of discomfort. it felt heavy and awkward. the dress was very high waisted for me (i\\'m 5\\'6\" and it was 3\" inches above the navel)) also to the point of discomfort.\\n\\nan invisible side zipper would have made the difference for me if the proportions were better suited for a non-petite sizing.\\n\\nthe fabric is quite beautifu This dress looked adorable online, but unfortunately, it\\'s not flattering at all, and it\\'s completely see-through. completely. the material is so thin that i can\\'t imagine it would hold up very well over time. this one is definitely going back. One wash wonder...i\\'m a s to m and went with a m but could have gone with a s with ease. after washing it was way shorter. it shrunk more than a whole size in cold water! i assumed everything came preshrunk but sadly disappointed. great for one wear. The shirt does have a weird yellow tinge as other reviewers have described. i could get over that if the shirt was a flattering fit which it was not. not worth the money so i returned it. Love these pants. it\\'s hard to get really dark dark black jeans with a little stretch, and these are perfect. i also like the cut as a bit of a change from skin tight leggings. and the fabric is super cool, like a lightweight brocade denim. i get compliments every time i wear them. I love this dress! i purchased the neutral motif in a large and it fits wonderfully. i have a double d chest and the top of this fits almost perfectly. it\\'s just a bit snug on top but still comfortable because of the fabric. i\\'m 5\"3 and the dress isn\\'t too long like most maxi\\'s are on me. i always have great luck with maeve and plan on purchasing another right now! I am powerless to resist hot air balloons and had to get these the moment they popped up! the pjs are charming and comfortable. the material feels very satiny. it\\'s hard to tell, but there are small white dots in the midst of the champagne colored background. true to size. This dress drapes very well and is flattering to many different body shapes. the colors give it the flexibility to wear from summer into fall. gorgeously designed! I usually wear a small or a medium in tee shirts, and i had to get a medium so that it fit comfortable throughout the shoulder area. This skirt is of the highest quality. the fabric and cut is that of a much higher priced item. the fabric at the seams matches!!! no one mentions any longer when fabric seams are mismatched as if that is nonconsequential. to me it means the difference between good and great. this skirt is great except for the sizing. as other reviewers have mentioned....it runs so small. i wear a size 6 skirt. could not zip the 6. ordered the 8 - it zips yet puckers and while it could work - i\\'d be exhausted fro My perspective is as a sewer so i\\'m more picky perhaps. this top is poorly made. the fabric pattern is crooked or not consistent in each piece. sewers do this to save $ - squeezing the pieces on the fabric. it looks sloppy. the cut is very full; the bottom edge measures 104\" around. for my figure, curvey, at 5\\'6\" and 150lbs, this top is not flattering it looks maternity. perhaps best on a slim figure and with leggings. First, this is thermal ,so naturally i didn\\'t expect super sheer, but it is. really sheer light fabric. i like it, but be prepared for considering who you might run into if you walk around the house in it. second, it is large. i ordered the size 0 and it\\'s a nice oversized fit for my 5\\'3\" 125 pounds. i wouldn\\'t want to go larger. along with being sheer, the fabric is easily stretched, which i don\\'t mind in this case. finally, the color. it looks white on my monitor and shows a colorful blue dot I bought this shift dress for a \"black & plaid\" nye event, and it fit the bill perfectly for a cold winter\\'s night. looks great with tights and boots, has pockets, and dresses up nicely. i like a good shift at this point in the holiday season -- leaves room for that last bit of seasonal eating and drinking. looking forward to wearing this through the winter months. Despite the delicacy of the fabric and femininity of the patterns, the cut of this blouse is rather androgynous and not in a flattering or modern way. ick. so disappointed. I wear stuff like this a lot so naturally i got this one. i love it and i think it\\'s flattering however it wrinkles easily and also when i hand washed in cold water it shrunk a little which super irritating, but i\\'m going to wear it anyway. i think it can be worn with many things so it\\'ll stay in rotation a while. True to size on the neckline and arms but extremely large and puffy in the torso. very unflattering cut! This skirt looks great on, i didn\\'t even think before buying it, planning to wear it all summer. so the aesthetic is great. quality and design, not so much. you get exactly one good wear out of it before the folding absolutely disintegrates, it is not sewn in or built to last. \\r\\n\\r\\nthen, it looks like a cheap sarong over a cheap miniskirt. i thought the dry cleaner might be able to fix it, but they said they would have to resew the whole garment, not exactly what you want to hear with almost bran This top is well made for the price! the colors are beautiful and will work well with jeans and a leather jacket if it is cooler. I so wanted this skirt to work, love the design! but, it\\'s way, way too long... i am 5, 5, 116lb, and the small is 1 inch on the floor. i step on the skirt as i walk. This is a lovely piece, with great shape and details. i think it would really stand out at events. i ended up returning it. i don\\'t have much occasion for cocktail dresses. i had trouble sending it back. it has a slip with the sheer overlay. the slip seemed a bit tight at the bottom hem for the shape of the dress. As the other reviewer stated the dress is not lined and the fabric feels very cheap. i tried the sp as well and felt i could have gone down to the xsp. i like the style and coloring but given the price and lack of quality this is going back. I love this top, it gives a little bit of a sleeveless look yet is more flattering on the arms for those who don\\'t normally wear sleeveless tops. i think it runs very large - i\\'m normally a size s/m and the extra small was right. it\\'s loose around the waist yet has a feminine fit.the tiny balls around the neck, button at the back, flutter sleeves, and linen fabric are all cute details that make this top unique. i also like how the fluttering goes down the sides and not just around the sleeve. I feel in love with this piece. the color are gorgeous and i received so many compliments. it lifted my mood just wearing it! sadly, ut the end of the first wear i had a run up the front and by the middle of the second wear the light fabric got caught on something and a hole developed. upon further inspection i found another hole at the top where the price tag must have been attached. i also noticed all over pilling after the first wear! so sad! they should recreate this in a heavy fabric. I was obsessed with this dress from the moment i saw it online and was so excited to buy it for my company christmas party. i\\'m 5\\'4\", 36c, 145lbs and i ordered a 6. the size was great but the whole cut of the dress was completely off for me. i have a fairly short torso but the top portion of the dress (which is a sweater-like material) hit me far too low on my waist to be flattering; the petite may have fixed it, but then the skirt would\\'ve been too short. the pleats were cute but flared out too Is a great top for layering over leggings, running errands or after the gym. the material was thin. i returned it because the color didn\\'t look great on me and for the price, i just didn\\'t love it. Love the print and was looking forward to this dress. the length and bust are just right in normal sizing, however the \\'swing\\' effect is all off. there\\'s so much fabric. its like wearing a moo moo. not at all flattering. disappointed in this one. The sweater is beautiful. i loved the tweed design. but the fit was boxy and the collar sat funny. so i had to send it back. I was surprised at the high quality of fabric; however, the dress looked like a muumuu on. maybe with a belt it would be cuter... The skirt is comfortable and as pictured. it also ran tts. i\\'m 5\\'5\" tall and weigh 140 lbs. i had the medium and didn\\'t need to size up to a large. when you put the skirt on a normal body, it looks like you are wearing an easter egg... and not in a good way. I had hopes for this shirt but was disappointed in the fabric...it\\'s very stiff and heavy for a summer blouse. will be returning it. Slouchy relaxed fit. well sewn together and hangs well on the body. bottom hem hits upper thigh. good length and soft, easy fabric. light layering option as well. good spring jacket, can be kept on indoors without getting too hot. I wish this dress was more fitted.. the dress looks more fitted and more vibrant in the picture. i bought this dress in an xs, but i am not sure that going smaller would take care of the amount of material in this dress. it was shapeless and did not fall as nicely as it appears. i think someone with a fuller figure would look very nice in this dress. sad to say that it is going back. I was hesitant to buy this because some reviews said that if you were busty it would fit tight and awkward across the chest.. i\\'m petite, 32c, 5ft and purchased the xsp in white .it is gorgeous! it fits a tiny bit big and i think i could have gotten away with a xxsp, but i like the flowiness of this size i have so i\\'m keeping it. it does not feel tight across the chest at all and hangs beautifully. i love it! the material is gorgeous and it is well made. I have been looking for lace shorts for years. yes, years! finally found these shorts that are perfect. the lace is sturdy, not flimsy, so they are not see-through. i purchased both the cream and the blue when they went on sale. my skin is a bit tan, so lighter-colored clothing can be see-through for me. both colors are fantastic and i get compliments on them all the time, especially the blue shorts. plus, they complement either a t-shirt or a blouse. i love the eyelash fringe at the hem - such I wanted to like this but it just didn\\'t have much of a shape, not flattering at all. maybe if i was taller? The print on this dress is really pretty and the styling with the lace is a nice touch. unfortunately, it runs quite small in the bust, so i had to return it. for someone that is small busted, it will be quite cute. everywhere else it is true to size. I am petite so ordered in the store and they shipped to my home. i ordered a 24p and they fit great. they stretch a tiny bit. goes with a lot of tops and they are light weight which is great with houston westher This didn\\'t work for me. it looks better unzipped. the piece made me look extremely top heavy, and i am by no means overweight, but i do have a larger chest on a small frame (36c, 5 feet, 115). honestly, it just made me look fat. the design is cute, but this is going back.. I loved the design and look to this shirt, but it ran way big for me. i loved the forgiving fit, but it just wasn\\'t flattering at all. i even went down one size and it still was huge. sad to send this one back. I love wearing sweaters when it gets cooler out but hate the bulkiness that comes with them. this is a super cute sweater that isn\\'t too bulky and gives you the sexiness you\\'re looking for! great material. When i first pulled this shirt from the box i thought it was a for sure winner. the beading was stunning, it was just so elegant and the details are perfection. \"till i tried it on and had some reservations. the sleeves (at the top) were very poofy and just would not lay in a flattering way unless they were rolled above my elbow to tighten them. and as a taller gal, i wish it were a tad longer (in the model shot, looks a bit short from the back view). i fear tucking it would loosen the bead work When i received the dress i went to try it on and one of the loops for the string to cinch the dress broke. guess that\\'s gonna have to go back I absolutely love this top!! i bought the ivory color, and i am definitely considering buying the black as well! it feels true to size, but i did size up only because i like my tops to fit a little generous and flowy. i can\\'t wait to wear this top all season long! I wore this blazer for one day, didn\\'t do anything strenuous, and the fabric started to disintegrate along the back, next to the center seam. it\\'s completely unfixable, since it\\'s not the seam that split but the fabric itself. what a waste of money.\\r\\n\\r\\nas to the fit, it is a boxy cut through the waist. it looks better unbuttoned than buttoned. the jacket also shows a lot of the shirt you have under it, so it\\'s good over something cute.\\r\\n\\r\\nor, it would be, if it didn\\'t fall apart. Love the knit, color, texture--but oddly a short and boxy fit...and so...not flattering. I tried this product in store in red and fell in love with the fit, it fits in the most beautiful flattering way, red looked gorgeous - rich glossy fabric, this could easily be one of those effortless summer transition pieces that can go from a day dress into incredible sexy night outfit. the fabric was very lush and had this rich gloss to it, i have never seen a fabric like that, it almost looked coated. red being such a statement piece was a bit too much for me, so i decided to order the produ Tried this on in the red because the pattern is so eye catching and beautiful. i couldn\\'t get it off fast enough. picture this: tight in the best, tight in the hips, extra billowy in the middle. so confused and can\\'t see how this would be flattering on anyone. unless you\\'re planning to repurpose the gorgeous fabric, skip. This sweater is fine for the casual days. i bought this in cream and i have to say after one wash it looks old. i\\'m a huge retailer lover and buy a lot of clothes from them. this is just not the best quality and looks tired after a few wears. very soft, but poor material. not my favorite purchase. Was really excited for this dress but should have paid more attention to the material it was made with. for the price of the dress, it felt very cheap. i didn\\'t even end up trying it on after i opened the packaging. the colors were not as vibrant as the picture. as another reviewer mentioned, it was more similar to something you would purchase off a boardwalk. very disappointed and will be returning. I really loved this dress. it ran small but it was also shorter than i imagined which was only worsened because i\\'m curvier on top. would be great for slender figures. Love retailer\\'s kimonos and when i saw this pattern i had to have it! unfortunately, when i bought it the tag was already showing holes so they gave me 15% off... went to wear it for the first time, there was already a huge snag in it! i love retailer but for 98$ this is not worth your money. I looked like i was going to work on a farm. well made, but seemed fit big. i like and have owned wide leg pants/capris, these were cartoonishly wide.\\n\\nneedless to say, they were returned. Straight out of the mail, this cozy soft adorable charming sweater was *full* of little pills. i love the embroidery, the swingy slightly oversized fit that doesn\\'t overwhelm and the high snuggle factor. wish this came in other colors and was knitted with a less fussy yarn. This sweater was pretty short. beyond that, when i raised my arms, the thickness of the sweater caused the shoulders to rise up and stay there when i put my arms down. This is a beautiful lightweight sheer blouse. the front has a liner and the arms and back are sheer. i usually wear a s or xs - the xs was plenty roomy. i\\'ll wear a cami due to the sheerness of the back .the cutouts in the long sleeves are quite pretty. overall this is a classy blouse that can be worn with any number of jeans, slacks or skirts. thanks retailer! I really wanted to love this sweater. the quality is good and it looks beautiful - until you need to lift your arms. i did end up keeping it but it is limited to when and where i can wear it due to the arm restrictions. i can see it in the picture but didn\\'t notice until purchasing - the arm holes and right next to the bottom of the sweater. slight design flaw. I agree with the other reviewer who stated this sweater is very \"80\\'s\"!! online it looks minorly fluffy with muted colors, but in person it\\'s a bad overly-fuzzy christmas sweater with super bright 80\\'s colors!! if you\\'re going for kitschy / tacky / retro this may work for you, but if you are looking for the sweater in the photo you\\'ll be disappointed... :( it looked to be true to size, but to be honest i hated it so much i didn\\'t even try it on. Bummed out.. this is super cheaply made and very expensive... the design is different , the color is beautiful, but the material is a different story.. it should be priced at the most 30 bucks.. not 128.. i\\'m returning them. also, they run very big..! I was really excited after finding this top online and reading the reviews; the combination of peplum, cap sleeves, and color seemed too good to be true. i ordered a size medium but unfortunately, this top is on the short side so wearing it with pants or jeans did not work out. in addition, the fabric was more sheer than it looks in the picture and the v-neck in front dipped a little lower, too. a camisole might have solved both of those problems but i didn\\'t bother. i returned it to the store. I\\'m so bummed! i absolutely loved the pair of these i bought in the bronze color great fit, great color, so comfortable! however, i just washed them and could tell right away when i laid them flat to dry that they had lost color in areas where they had wrinkled in the wash machine. so, now they have strange lighter lines running along them. not acceptable. \\r\\n\\r\\ni will say that the two lighter colors may not have this issue. for reference, see my stats. i bought a 26. I really loved this vest online and decided to try it on in store. it was really cute on and fit nicely so i purchased it (in my normal size) and took it on a vacation. first time wearing it and the color transferred all over my white shirt even though it says it is pre-washed. i am very disappointed considering how expensive this was. overall, it is very cute but it may ruin your clothes so beware! This skirt is beautiful. fabric is gorgeous,with perfect amount of shine and luxury to it. there is a \"life \"in this skirt; it is well made and follows the body lines in a perfect way. or,i better say, it did fit me perfectly first ten minutes of wearing it. unfortunately, it stretched more than a full size, and generally lost its shape. now, the skirt is two sizes too large and not really wearable anymore. I just ordered this item and wore it yesterday. received compliments from my friends. truly a great sweater. feels soft to the touch. i love the cut and how it falls around my hips. sleeves were nice and long. i am a tall lady with long arms. almost 6 ft, weighing about 155. i got the med which was a perfect fit for me. love the off white. almost thinking of getting the peachy pink too. This dress looks nothing like the photo. the sequins are dull, no sheen at all. the faux leather panels and straps look and feel like cheap, shiny plastic. i didn\\'t even try it on, because it was so hideous, when i pulled it out of the box. not remotely worth the price and wouldn\\'t buy it on sale for $20 either. skip. Unexpected delight! great top that can be dressed up or down. the only con is a little small through the bust. This sweater is the perfect sweater except for one thing.....it sheds everywhere. i can simply pick up the sweater and shake it in one hand and 40 large pieces of lint go everywhere on the ground and on you. if you like dark jeans- don\\'t purchase. before i walked out of the store- the salesperson had to use a delineator on me- it was hysterical. sheds so much I am short waisted, and generally a petite on the top, so a lot of these sweater vest toppers i find to be too long in the torso for me. this one, however, is the perfect exception. it is soft, but with some structure, comfortable, and not too hot for warmer weather climates during the spring. i bought it in seattle, though i live in dallas, and found it to be a perfect layering piece with a 3/4 white t-shirt and a jean jacket, while walking around the rainy city. \\r\\nfyi: 5\\'2\", short waist, broad The styling of this top is so cute but the fabric is thin, kind of scratchy & has\\r\\nalmost no give to it.  it is very uncomfortable on & is very restricting as far as\\r\\nmovement is concerned.   cannot recommend - back it goes! I love the fit of these pants -- they\\'re the perfect slim black pants. however, i wore these pants exactly three times before the seams split the middle of the pant in not just one, but multiple places. disappointed by the workmanship/quality of the product, especially since the pants fit amazingly and don\\'t sag like other slim fitting black pants tend to do. i hope retailer will take this into consideration and improve the quality of future iterations of this product. An awful dress! retailer why didn\\'t you post my last review. i would not even give it a quarter of a star. This was a very nice sweater but i had to return because it came too late for a birthday gift i was giving. it also was not the sweater i had originally thought i had ordered. my mistake. it was very soft and would be suitable for any type of figure. I am 5\\'2\" and got this in a 6p. i would say it fits tts (the top also has some give), but the waist is just a few inches away from being empire. i think the dress on the model is pulled down to de-emphasize this. even so, it is a very cute dress - plan to wear it with a navy velvet jacket for easter. I think when this is new, it runs big, and then shrinks to the right size. that\\'s what it did for me anyway. it did shrink after one wash, but not significantly. i bought it in m and feel it stayed within that range. super cute with shorts - airy, light. love the white. ordering another color! Ordered this in the neutral motif, size large and it\\'s a great little dress. comfortable and cute, but modest enough that i\\'m not worried about my bust (38d) hanging out too much. the v-neck hits at the perfect spot. the sleeves are the perfect 3/4 length, not too tight and it\\'s not too short on me (5\\'9\"). i\\'m a light blonde and i don\\'t feel washed out in this. it hides a little belly well without being a tent. also, the lining is super soft and flexible. the only problem is the upper back falls As the other reviewer said, the skirt had this weird bunching on both sides of the hips-it was ridiculous. i don\\'t know how anyone could wear it-looks like you had two little triangle things poking out from each hip. i\\'m long and lean so usually skirts like this fit me well. very very strangely constructed-i couldn\\'t keep it even at the deeply discounted price Pros: pretty, nicely made.\\r\\n\\r\\ncons: the fabric is stiffer than i was expecting, and the blouse cuts in under the arms. (i don\\'t mean that it is tight or digs in, but it cuts in; you can\\'t tell in the angle of the photo.) the blouse is short as well, and, as i am curvy, it really stuck out all around at the waist. worth trying on if you have a straighter figure. Got the wine color and love it! the design definitely is slimming! 5\\'1, 120lb, got  size 4. I was really excited for this jacket to arrive but it\\'s going back. because the fabric is coated, it does not drape or hang nicely at all. i expected it to be boxy but it sticks out so oddly in every direction that it looks horrible. i\\'m usually an xs and ordered an xs and it looks ridiculous on me. Bought this for my girlfriend and she couldn\\'t be happier! she\\'s a size 4/34c and the small fits perfectly and is so flattering and comfortable. highly recommend. These cords are a great, skinny fit.  they seem true to size for me and look great on.  only issue i would have is the color says navy, but they are more of a deep purple-ish color.  i had to recheck my order because they definitely aren\\'t navy....but i\\'m keeping them because the fit is awesome. Unfortunately i didnt read the fine print when i ordered this re: dry cleaning only, but this in itself wasnt a total deal breaker. it did fit well -- i am 5\\'2, 32c, 107 lb and the xs petite fit very well, definitely form-fitting, not long in the arms or waist. the grey heather design was not my favorite look, actually thats the main reason i am returning it -- there was a dark grey splotch of the heathered design on the chest, and it looked like i had a huge dark stain. I love these pants, i actually bought them twice! the special dye in them did not agree with my detergent so i bought another pair on sale.....some woolite and will wash them inside out/hang to dry. will take better care of my second pair. I agree a few others, it may be a little bit boxy but i don\\'t even care because it\\'s so beautiful! definitely a top i\\'m going to love long after this floral craze the fashion world is in begins to fade. I love this sweater. i didn\\'t buy it the first time when i tried it at the store because the buttoned look created a bulk on one side and i thought that this was very weird. it might have been what i was wearing underneath that day or that particular sweater. but then at 40% off i decided to give it another try and i\\'m happy that i did. i bought the navy and i love the feel of the material. sizing down makes all the difference, too. i wasn\\'t fan of the attached sleeves at first as they are made Really nice, substantial, fully lined sweater coat. i love the structured look and the faux-leather piping around the zipper and the pockets. quality seems to be very good. it runs true to size, maybe slightly on the small side (especially for larger hips/busts) so if you are in between sizes, go up. i chose small and it\\'s just right; i wouldn\\'t be able to zip around my hips with xsmall. besides the price, which is why i dropped one star, i cannot really find any fault in this sweater coat. Love love this dress! i got the regular size, but the length is more on the petite side. it\\'s shorter than what i\\'m comfortable with, so will probably return it. This dress is super bulky and unflattering. the knit is loose and see-through. looks like it was knitted by a five-year old. if you need a dress that adds twenty pounds then this is for you. back to the store it goes I love the pattern adn color combo, but, wow,t really flatering on me. too much fabric. i felt like i was trying to hide wight gain or pregnancy or wearing a mumu. anyway, not for me, but others might toll wnat to try in case it was just me... too bad.\\n\\nlength was decent in regulat size though, not too long. just too wide. I loved the fit, color and style, but the fabric seemed very thin and cheap. i was worried that it would tear easily. this is getting returned. I splurged on this pajama set for myself and now regret it. even though the design is adorable, the knitted fabric contains acrylic and started pilling a lot within the first week of wear. after a month and a couple washes, it looks horrible. it may be the worst case of pilling i\\'ve ever seen in a fabric. so so disappointed. it initially fit true to size but has stretched out a bit over time. The dress is absolutely beautiful in person. the blue stripes are a bit brighter and the print on top is more muted. it\\'s unique and sure to turn heads. being 5\\'2\" i tried on the small petite. this size is usually perfect (lengthwise) for me. however this dress was about 2\" too long. another complaint is the style of the top half. the model in the picture seems to be hiding the puffiness of the top half. the top half puffs out and made me appear much wider than i am. not a good look on anyone. Really cute suit but way too small up top. not enough coverage under arms and across bust.i wish retailerpolgie carried bathing suits in the stores so they can be tried on. this is the 2nd suit i have ordered that had to be returned. i wont order a bathing suit again as its just to much of a risk. I ordered this dress in both colors. i\\'m very fair and blonde and the darker dress just swallowed me up - looked really messy on me. the lighter one.....love it. it\\'s very flowy and not form fitting, of course, but something about the lighter color just seems less overwhelming. This caught my eye in the store last week, and i decided to try it on. it\\'s the perfect lightweight jacket. the photos here show it as activewear, but i think the details on it allow it to be much more versatile. it\\'s very flattering and i found it to run true to size. Really disappointing quality. these jeans are of a very poor quality material and developed holes in the inseams after only a month! i love pilcros, and am totally shocked at the poor quality...retailer, i hope this is just a fluke. not worth the money! I purchased this sweater in black to dress up my everyday cardigan. this is very soft and can dress up a skirt or great with jeans. I thought this dress looked really cute and many people gave it great reviews. for me, there were a few key things off for it to work. i thought the material was soft, although not thick as you might expect with a turtleneck style dress. i ordered a small and the top fit ok, the arms were a little tight. then the larger problem was the body, it hides everything which is great but the way it fell and just sort of hung there, it didn\\'t do anything for my figure and was not flattering around the wa Love the way this dress looks online. sadly, it doesn\\'t look great on me. i\\'m 5\\'4\", athletic build. the small fit perfectly, but the extra fabric in the hip/pocket area just seemed to drag me down. i really wished this worked for me, but i think you\\'ve gotta be a little bit taller to pull this one off. This dress is so vibrant in person. i am 5\\'10\" and the length is perfect. having a small waist helps too. certainly worth the $49 i spent on it. watch the sales. several times ill go to pay for an item, and its even cheaper that advertised. the uniqueness that retailer embodies is what i love the most about their clothing. i\\'m a size 10, ordered a medium These pants are so flattering, comfortable, and silky smooth. a versatile fall staple for sure. i bought my usual 28 and they fit perfectly. Ok, received this in the mail yesterday and tried on this morning, i ordered the size 2 snd it is really big. i notice that the armhole sag and there is a lot of extra room everywhere. i am a 32d on the top so that is why i ordered the size 2, but i will return this and order the size 0 and i hope that will take care of the sagging arm area Not just another striped tee. perfect drape & lightly fitted at the bottom sides so it skims the body & is super flattering. the subtle shimmer is just right. love the gray! very versatile & irresistible. i\\'m a size 4/small & this is tts. I love the details that this cardigan has. try it! This dress is very pretty in person. it fits true to size and is very figure flattering. one other reviewer mentioned it is a bit low cut, but i think that can be resolved by wearing a cami underneath to cover cleavage. my only gripe with this dress is that it\\'s a little rough and stiff feeling. i am really sensitive to that and only buy things that are velvety soft. it probably works for most people but not for me, so had to go back. I loved the design of this blouse and ordered it the first day it was available. unfortunately, i was disappointed on arrival. besides being more muted color-wise, the sizing is way off. i ordered the xxsp and it was huge on me. on the model, it looks like it skims the body, when in reality, it falls like a tent. i tried tucking it into a skirt, but there was just too much fabric.\\r\\n\\r\\nthough the neck worked for me, i can see how it might be too small for some people as it is very narrow. also, it I love this dress so much i bought it in 2 colors, it\\'s so soft and cozy, i want to live in it! I was so excited about this top, super cute and fit perfectly but as soon as i washed it (cold, hand wash, air dry) it shrunk! now it is too short and tight. i did not expect the material to shrink so very disappointed. I needed to write a review only because i feel like the dress is getting a bad rap by other reviewers. it is a loose, flowy, swing dress. i typically wear structured fit and flare dresses, but i do love a feminine, loose, casual dress from time to time too. this totally fit the bill. it is true to size, fitted on the arms, loose and swingy everywhere else. i got the peach color and love it. the cotton slip underneath is very comfortable too. i ordered the sp and it hits just above my knees in th Unfortunately, does not look anything like in the picture. looks like an oversized house robe. i expected much more but was disappointed. i am definitely returning it. I am of average height, but these pants are so long!! i considered altering them because i like the print, but i don\\'t think it\\'s worth the effort for workout attire so they\\'re going back. shame!! After multiple purchase and returns (from other sites!) i decided to splurge on a dress for my college graduation (located beach side). this dress was better than i could have hoped. the fit is very flattering, loose & tight in all the right places. the adjustable straps underneath the overlay ensure the silk lays perfectly. the colors are gorgeous and the fabric is light as a feather. the slight train & back buttons adds elegance to an otherwise \"casual\" floral pattern. i would highly recommend I love this vest! it is a great color and the inside is very soft! i will definitely be able to dress it up or down.\\r\\nif you are in between sizes i would definitely size up if you plan on wearing this with a little heavier turtleneck/blouse underneath.\\r\\nit\\'s amazing! i feel so confident in it! This shirt was great for one wear. after just one wash (followed instructions to dry clean) it lost all shape and now hangs like a bed sheet. terrible waste of money on a pricey top. This top does look as pictured, the sleeves hit me the same and the size was true... i just didn\\'t like it... it was shorter than i wanted in length and i just didn\\'t feel like this top was worth the price so it\\'s going back. i feel like i have had shirts with this texture and over time, they just didn\\'t wear as well so i was afraid with 3 kids it wouldn\\'t be a good idea. i paired it with a blazer and it looked great, but on it\\'s on, i don\\'t know, just not for me. for reference, i am 5\\'8\\'\\' 128lb As the other reviewers stated, it does run large, i sized down 1 size and it\\'s perfect. great dress to wear so many ways. I really wanted to like this dress on me, but it was not to be. the color is one of my favorites, but the dress accented all my problem areas. sadly, i returned it. i\\'m sure that someone with less substantial hips will look great in it. I purchased the green in xs and it fits perfect. it\\'s very flattering. also, i purchased the blue in xxsp (only size available), but it was too short. I can\\'t believe this top hasn\\'t sold out. it is a great casual top that will go well with anything. i agree with previous reviewer that talked about sizing up to cover straps. i did size up to a large but it didn\\'t get huge around the midsection. i got the red and it will go great with pilcro khakis or denim. I have these tops in white and blue. very comfotable to wear. the back part swings with movements and is flattering. good price so i got one for my daughter! I really was looking forward to this piece but unfortunately it was too small to even pass through my head nevertheless i couldn\\'t even get both arms in. i got a size small and probably needed a large; but as far as the quality and color, it\\'s really pretty! just go up a size or two if anything and try it out. I was not a fan. cute design but the sweater was not soft it felt thick like a weird blanket. the arms were small and the body was big... odd combo. the material didn\\'t make me want to put it on. it went back. So i really loved this dress. i am tall (6ft) and the size 8 was perfect length. i would have worn it with flat dressy sandals. i would say it is true to size. i am not a flowy dress kind of girl but this was just the perfect amount of \"flow\" without making me feel like i was wearing a long potato sack. the back is just gorgeous and unique. here is why i couldn\\'t make it mine. the tube top part is completely detachable and extremely thin. there is literally not much to it and i\\'m not sure it wou I knew i needed to buy this trench from the moment i saw it on my computer screen, but something prompted me to stop by my local retailer and try it on first. thank goodness for that.\\r\\n\\r\\nat first glance, i knew i wouldn\\'t be buying this. the construction leaves much to be desired. from the flimsy, single layer of unlined, unstructured fabric, to the thin strip of fabric serving as a belt, i could easily see this being sold at a cheap store for teenage girls where throwaway clothes are a dim I really wanted to like these. they\\'re soft, long enough for 5\\'8 1/2 and a nice color cut the rise is quite low and the hips puffed out in a weird way. have to return ;( I love the design on this top- so playful! i was super confused on what size to buy since all the reviews said different things, so i bought a size 0 and size 2. i\\'m usually a size 0 or xs is most clothes, and after trying both on, i kept the size 0. it\\'s ever so slightly snug in the chest area, but the sleeves and shoulder areas fit perfectly. the size 2 was a little too wide and drapey and the sleeves were a little long. This suit was high quality, and a cute design. however, it is clearly made for a lean body type. I bought this dress in the cream color. it was sold out online in most sizes but i stumbled upon it in person and immediately had to have it. i\\'m usually xs or small, and bought the small. they did not have an xs available so i can\\'t compare, but the small was flattering and comfortable. i\\'m 5\\'5\" 120 (34c) and it falls perfectly at my ankles (no dragging) and looks great with simple, neutral sandals. as some reviewers have mentioned it has some weight to it, so it\\'s probably not great for hot da I love this top. it looks exactly like the picture except the sleeves are not full length; they are closer to 3/4 length. the color is vibrant and the material is light and comfortable. Beautiful shorts, good length but if you have lots of lower body curves- probably not for you! I saw this skirt online and had to have it. as another reviewer mentioned, the color is more of a yellowy ivory. the skirt is very pretty, but also has a very thick/heavy satin polyester lining. i don\\'t feel like i could wear it during the summer because the thick poly lining wouldn\\'t breathe. that was the deciding factor and sadly i\\'ll have to return it. So this is a great tee, problem is the white you can see through. i an not looking for a layering tee so not what i was looking for. Now, i ordered both striped versions and i don\\'t know which to keep... the material is a nice soft knit. the neck line is almost boat-neck, with little buttons, so cute. colors are really nice too. i tried it on with skinnies and trousers,a nd ti looked great with both. i went with the petite version, for those shorter gals out there... xxs petite fit me, i havne\\'t tried o the xs petite yet. (5\\'1.5\" and 115 lbs). i think it would loke nice with a pencil skirt too, if i only had one that went wit I wanted to love this top. perfect weight, length, and shape. unfortunately, the seam goes right through the bust and just does not look right. if you are tiny on top, this will be lovely on you. I bought the navy polka dot top and i love the way the design lets you work orange into your wardrobe if it\\'s a color you wouldn\\'t normally wear. the blouse is sheer so a camisole is needed underneath; i\\'m looking forward to layering over the blouse in the fall to add a pop of pattern to a navy sweater.\\r\\ni\\'m a 34f and size 12 fit me easily with extra room under the arms. the gathering stops above the bust so that it fit\\'s snug above and loose below. worn loose, the blouse is fairly long, coverin I ordered this in blue and the color is absolutely gorgeous! i really loved it until i put it on. wow it was bad. i ordered a small--normally a sm/med due to bust but this was so wide and had so much material. it wasn\\'t long but rather incredibly boxy. one of the most unflattering things i\\'ve ever tried at retailer. This was going to be my go to top. i loved the look of the billowy shirt, especially in light blue. when it arrived, i knew it wouldn\\'t work for my body. i\\'m athletic build with muscular upper arms and a d cup. i tried it on anyway. i really wish it fit. it was snug in the upper arms and pulled a bit in the front. i knew if i ordered a size up the arms would still be tight. it\\'s just the cut of the shirt. this top is best for someone that isn\\'t busty and has slender upper arms. Nice work dress. flirty style for spring. I was in love with the green print, so i ordered this despite the reviews. i wish i\\'d listened. the fit is incredibly weird--huge at the top but tapering in at the hips. so sad this didn\\'t work. Beware. white is not white. white is more cream, off-white, light beige. i was really looking forward to these shorts but was immediately disappointed when i saw the color. they are cute, but not white. i bought them to wear with the nautical look tops for this summer, but unfortunately, creamy colored shorts don\\'t do much for navy/white tops.also, the button is very difficult to open/close.otherwise they are ok. Sized up due to my 36ddd breastfeeding bust and the 14 for perfectly.  i am 5\\'6 and 165lbs, just fyi.  dress is super flattering on my post 4-baby body.  it\\'s very slimming.  looking forward to wearing to a casual wedding, I wanted to love these jeans, but as a woman who is almost 45 there was way too much stretch in them. i am always a size 26 and i couldn\\'t wear these, they were way too tight! they went back the next day. i will say, it could be my body type, i\"m a runner so my legs are muscular. if you have very thin legs, these could be great and work for you. i loved the color, dark blue. This is a gorgeous buttondown. the colors are stunning - i love the mix of blue and brown. the fabric is super soft and drapes just right. i feel the this shirt runs true to size. i\\'m an xxs petite and it fit perfect. this one is a winner! The sides scooped up a bit too much on me. i was hoping to be able to tuck this into a skirt and wear to work, but there were definitely some gaps that showed the side of my midriff. back it goes. :( I really wanted to love this. sadly, the first thing i noticed was how tight it was in the arms and across the back (size up maybe even two sizes). secondly, it\\'s see through! a top like this looses it\\'s finesse to me once i can see my pant line and bra. it\\'s very difficult to do the three buttons in the back yourself and finally, good luck taking it off without getting make up all over the neckline. someone dubbed it the \"poor man\\'s pineapple top.\" i couldn\\'t agree more, sigh. i really did want In a word .. clingy ... and not in good way. long so you need it to flow not cling. liked the back, but front was just too clingy. back it goes. This sweater is thick and does cover the bra well. i did not find it to be well made. the ribbing seemed to be attached loosely in places. i am a size large with a b cup and a bit thicker through the middle to my middle age dismay. putting this sweater on in coral made me feel like a giant peach. for those with larger breasts it is likely more flattering. I\\'m not sure if the top i received was damaged or if the design didn\\'t consider gravity but this is not what i expected. i really want to like this top, but i don\\'t see how i can wear it. I saw this very shirt online & thought it was so pretty. in person, the shirt seems flimsy. the buttons look as though they\\'d fall off. i also didn\\'t like the cut of the shirt. it seemed to be tighter on top & looser on the bottom. had to return. i couldn\\'t justify the cost with the quality. I liked the look of this dress online, so i called my local store and had them hold it in a small and medium because of the reviews. i am a 34dd, and had no issues with the bust on the small dress. it\\'s a pretty, feminine dress and i\\'m glad they had the 20% off sale when i decided to buy it. the reason i\\'m writing a review is because the dress here is not the same as the dress in the store. the dress in the store is pictured in the \"get the look\" photo. the dress in the store has cap sleeves, wh Beautiful dress. the details are lovely. it feels a little bit like a nightgown. i always wear a slip. bust does run a little small so i unbutton the first few buttons. armholes feel a little small also. I was disappointed in this vest, it was stiff and scratchy and seems too big, doesn\\'t drape well fromm the armpit and bust line area. not very figure flattering, looks like i put a blue shopping bag on and belted it to try to add flair! This has such awful proportions. i\\'m 5\\'0 and 100 lbs, ordered xxs petite (in the neutral color). the seam at the bust literally hits in the middle of my bust!! it looks very unflattering, and it\\'s very pronounced. i\\'m only 5\\'0 and already the seam hits at such a high point on me. below the seam the sweater is all scrunched up where it\\'s sewed, and it balloons outward and is very square from there down. very shapeless sweater and not flattering at all unless you have your arms by your sides to hi Fell in love with this dress when i saw it. beautiful design and flow. although it needs an underskirt, because it is a see through. also it is a bit tight on the chest section. i haven\\'t wore it yet, so more to come.. Awesome light shrug. goes with so many out fits, over tees and dresses. tts. get one! orange color is a pretty neutral. My usual size was a bit large and baggy in most areas but the bust was sooo soo small. the button popped and i had barely moved. do not recommend this one for anyone with a bust. the detailing is very pretty though for someone that can make this work. This is the most beautiful and flattering skirt. it was a bit of an investment piece for me in that i just graduated from college, but i love that this skirt can be worn year round. it is more fitted at the top and then flows out at the bottom, making it super flattering. pictures do not do it justice! I finally was able to order the xs petite (my typical size), adn received it. i had previously tried on the xs regular, but that was too much fabric. (i am 5 foot 1.5 inches, adn 115 lbs)\\r\\n\\r\\nso the petite fit, but i still felt like the swing was a lot of fabric for me. classic cut, snug on the chest,so i wouldn\\'t be able to wear a sweater underneath. overal, i did like,but decided to returrn it This will be a cardigan i will wear across all seasons. if you want to layer a button down or another long sleeve shirt under it i would suggest sizing up one size. as soon as i put this on it felt like it molded to me. it\\'s beautiful! and comfortable. I wanted to love this tunic sweater. the material is so soft and a perfect weight. the color is pretty. bu the fit absolutely did not work for me. the tunic runs very small. a large usually fits me but i felt like i was wearing a small. the slits are quite high. i was sorry to do it but this one went straight back! This is a beautiful blouse however it runs big. i order the small and had to return it. my measurements are 5\\'4 135 34c-28-38 for reference. you will not regret buying this blouse but it has to be the right size if not it would look like it did on me, frumpy. i kept taking it off and putting it back on trying to make it work (because i liked the material that much) but if you look at the model she has her arms straight down. when i lifted my arms i had 3 inches of extra material on both side. th Good quality fabric and structure but the mix media details and lines make them seem more like jodphurs than leggings. it\\'s hard to see where i would wear them ... sorry but they have to go back. I ordered a petite medium in black, and it fit great great. some of the other reviews said it was tight, but i found it pretty loose and flowy. also felt it was plenty of coverage - wore it to work (casual workplace) and transitioned to happy hour beautifully. I love a good peplum top, and was so excited when it arrived, but was sad to find the flare on the peplum was a little too much. i\\'m not sure why it was so unflattering, because in every other way, it fit like a dream, but it seemed like either there was too much or too little fabric around the waist to have it hang properly. it had to go back. I don\\'t normally spend so much on t shirts but this one is worth it. really well made and quite unique. i reckon i\\'ll get a lot of use out of it, I really love this addition to my wardrobe. the colors are great and it is very comfortable. my only complaint is that it runs large. it would be nice if they had more than two sizes. I would have loved this top if it were the length pictured on the model, but it was a cropped length on me :( I must agree with some of the other reviewers--this sweater is so pretty! but the quality of the sweater is not great. my sensitive skin found it to be itchy. so sadly i had to return it. I\\'m always looking for something that is unique and can be layered. this looks just like it does on the model. you\\'ll need a cami underneath as it is not lined. a little shorter in front than in the back but drapes nicely. styled it with black denim ankle jeans, black loafers (or boots), and a blue denim jacket. i\\'m 118#, 34d, 5\\'4\" and the s fit well. I wanted to love this dress - and did from the picture online. when it arrived, the black already looked faded and old. also, the embroidery looks like a grandma, but not in a cute vintage way. the fabric is stiff, which causes a boxy, unflattering look. had to return it. I have a few pairs of the stevie ankle, so i thought i try these. they have very little stretch and feel tight in the waist. the distressing near the front pockets is really apparent...like white stripes. they make the jean look overall cheap. not worth $198, in my opinion. Oh such a classic retailer look for summer! a vintage pattern on a crisp cotton fabric. i was immediately drawn to it. but wait- there is a sort of wrap around tie at the waist, creating the look of an apron. yes. it looks like one is wearing a full apron. or scrub dress. \\r\\nwhy?? this would have been sooo much better as a simple shift or a skirt/blouse combo. This is another item i\\'ve been stalking that i thought miraculously made it to sale with my size still available. i ordered online but when it arrived i have to be honest i didn\\'t even try it on because i knew it would be going back. the beautiful print online looks really cheap irl on the flimsy fabric. the beaded detail on neck is basically a low grade sequin trim. so much potential just executed poorly. This cute dress was very nice on. however my only reservations were the thickness in the arm sleeves. the dress has this thick curtain like material on the sleeves that seemed to big and cut way to wide for my skinny arms. i thought about bringing this to the tailor but i feel it would be a lot of work and the bulkiness of the arms would just be the same.\\n\\nother than that the colors and dress are beautiful. I love this dress. colors are great, but a little tight in the chest and arms. i am 5\\' 8\" and usually wear a size 6. i bought the medium because i like a little looser fit on top. the arm holes are a little large which makes reaching up for things awkward. I  absolutely fell in love with the stress when i sought in the store. the fabric and drape of the fabric is amazing! however, it runs extremely small. i normally wear a medium and can sometimes even wear a small and dresses. i tried on the medium and the large and i could not even get them zipped all the way.  i\\'m so disappointed, as this is a gorgeous dress.  definitely size up at least one, maybe two sizes. I read all the reviews and was hoping that this top would work for me, but it did not. i ordered a size smaller than usual and it was still way too big. it was not flattering at all on my curvy frame. overall, it looked more like a maternity top on me then anything else! if you\\'re tall and slender, i think this top would work! I love the colors of this dress, and i waited for the sale since it isn\\'t really good for work. i wear size 6 in hd all the time, but this one doesn\\'t fit at all on the top. the bust is cut for someone really curvy, but the bottom is for someone really straight. i don\\'t know what they were using for a model, but this has to be tried on before purchased. the material is also rough, and there is no lining to protect you from that. i love my hd dresses for style and functionality, but this one is j I washed and dried this in my dryer after one wear and it shrunk to the size of a toddler shirt. i dried it on medium. i can not really wear it unless i want to show off my belly. i loved the color (lilac). fit, and style when i received it and immediately put it on. so sad about the shrinkage. for a $58 shirt i expected a bit more. retailer should suggest air drying the shirt. so bummed and disappointed!!!! i would not recommend this shirt unless you can remember to air dry it every time. Saw this on the sale rack and decided to try on. i looked like the dancing hypos in the movie fantasia. i am petite and not heavy but this is for very slim and tall people. too much fabric in the peplum part. I usually wear small, ordered xs and it\\'s still way too large. quality not that great, just meh, returning it. This top is comfortable and pretty plus, i like the extra length in the sleeves. it is very lightweight and i\\'m cold natured so, i wear a bra top tankini underneath for warmth. This jacket is just as stunning in person as online. high quality and just overall fabulous design. as much as i loved it though i couldn\\'t get over the fact i was jingling every time i moved. it seemed like it could cause piling issues and i thought it might get annoying wearing for an entire day. i loved this and wanted so hard to keep it but i need functional chic pieces not noise makers. anyways fit was great looked just like the model on me so i would recommend but with caution as for this Dress is pretty, i was disappointed by the slip which is too small like previous customer. i am an inch taller than the model and i feel more comfortable it being a tunic with leggings. nice but not nice enough to keep, i am returning. :( I loved this dress. it fit perfectly everywhere except for the sleeves. the dress has an overall relaxed fit, but the sleeves were way too tight. i had to send back because of sleeves. The dress has a flattering cut and is a nice color. but, the fabric looks like old, matted carpet. i will be returning. After readying the reviews of this dress, i thought for sure i was purchasing a winner. boy, was i wrong! first, this dress feels like a potato sack and looked like one on. i felt that it was very boxy and more of a o\\' one size fits all\\' sizing. it did not embrace my curves at all. the material was not as chic as i would have thought. overall, the entire dress was not flattering. honestly, i do not understand what the rave reviews were talking about it. This top could\\'ve been one of my favorites ever. i ordered the rose option and was planning on ordering another color. the fabric is super thin but i was able to wear w/o an extra tank. unfortunately after 2 wears, several small holes appeared around the neck/under the ruffle. i washed this top on hand wash cycle and hung to dry. when i came to read the reviews, i noticed i wasn\\'t the only customer with this issue. I am so sad i have to return these leggings. they\\'re adorable--so much so that my fiancã© commented favorably on them--but as other reviewers have pointed out, there\\'s no elastic or string in the waistband so you have to walk around holding them up with one hand or they\\'ll fall down! why, sleeping on snow? whyyyyyyyyyyy? they\\'re so great otherwise! Fun, sexy underwear but rides up in the front. will return I am a big tracy reese fan, she knows how to cut a dress to flatter the best and hides the worst of a woman\\'s body. i\\'m 5\\'2\", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips and size regular 4 fits very well, it makes my waist look tiny which is awesome and the length is right at my knees. the v neck is a bit low cut so i would need a camisole if worn to work. i like the 2 layer skirt slip, but the ruffle part at the hem needs to be steamed straight or the dress would look too bumpy. colors are rich and unique! I had high hopes for this dress but my husband said i looked pregnant and that i was wearing a tablecloth- and he was right! i\\'m usually a size 10 so perhaps this would look good on a talk lanky person with a very long torso... but probably not. way too much fabric around the midsection. it\\'s a shame because the fabric was really pretty, but too stiff a hand to drape well. These jeans are beautiful. as the other reviewers have noted...they run very large...like 2 sizes, even then they are very stretchy. the embroidery is dark blue (looks black on screen)....lovely pair of jeans. if they had other colors i would by them! This top is lovely and flowy! it fits true to size, and the lace detail at the neck is perfect to make this top stand out. i felt like it was a little sheer, but it wasn\\'t problematic enough for me to take away a star :-) I\\'m a fan of yumi kim dresses and consistently wear size small. so, i ordered this in a small, and the top was a little loose, but it was way too short. there\\'s no way i would feel comfortable wearing this in public. i\\'m 5\\'7\", and the hem was higher than mid-thigh on me. the waist is also billowy and has no defined shape. I love this suit. it is a really cute color way & stripe and the fabric is nice, but... i ordered an xl. i have 20-30 extra pounds on me leftover from my last child. i am currently wearing a 10 or a 12. this suit would be great for a thinner girl, but i could not wear this suit to the family pool. the bottom is cut kind of skimpy and the breast area does not have much support. this xl would be a better fit on an 8-10. it will need to go back. I ordered the orange version in size xl. it fits true to size. the fit on me matches the online photos. it\\'s so comfortable to wear. i love the unique details of it. i\\'ve washed & air-dried it too. it retained its size. the color is outstanding. it\\'s such a pretty shade that looks more red online than it does in person. there\\'s more of a darker orange tint to it. i\\'ve gotten a lot of use out of this tee. hopefully it\\'ll come back in the fall in more colors. The fabric and its texture didn\\'t meet my expectations unfortunately. there were too much fray and cast-off of edge yarns of a fabric... \\r\\nhowever this will fit if you wear over the swimming wears. I wanted to love this shirt so much! i got this as a gift for christmas in the black. the first time i wore the shirt 3 of the buttons on the back fell off. keep in mind that they are not decorative and they held the shirt together. needless to say i was not so pleased to have my shirt fly open from the back. retailer and their amazing customer service took this shirt back no problem, but i wanted to give the fair warning! I bought this shirt in a l, since i didn\\'t want it to be too fitted and was concerned a m would be. it is so boxy! it\\'s like a completely different shirt. i have no idea how it looks good on anyone, unless it is simply widened the larger the size. maybe a m wouldn\\'t be as wide and therefore as boxy, but this shirt is just a bad mess. returning. Absolutely love this shirt - the embroidery on the front is beautiful. gold and silver metallic thread with good quality. very slim fit through the torso with loose sleeves. the only downside is the cream material is very sheer - definitely have to wear a tank underneath. I wanted to love this dress! the material is beautiful! but sadly i agree with other reviewer. the model definitely has this pinned back! i am on the small side (5\\'5\", 120 lbs, straight figure, very tiny \"girls\") and this dress looked awful. totally swallowed what little shape i have and the swing did make me look prego in front and back. the fabric is stiff so i think that adds to the sticking out oddly. as far as sizing the arm jokes fit great. xs ordered and length was good but wish the \"swin Beautiful shirt! i recently purchased this on sale and it has been marked down even further so definitely buy it! it is very pretty with the gold interwoven in the material. the peplum is also not overwhelming. it looks great with a pair of jeans and heels. my husband immediately commented on this shirt and he does not notice anything? This top looks so pretty on the model. however, the photo is deceiving as the bottom section is quite wide and loose. i am petite but between a c+ to d cup. the top is not really fitted, so my bust pushed the top out and made it look like a maternity piece. from the side it hung way in front of my body. i am wondering if this is clipped in the back on the model. if you are smaller chested and taller, this top might look nice on you. i am 5\\'1\", 105 lbs and c-d cup. i really loved the fabric and c I splurged on this pajama set for myself and now regret it. even though the design is adorable, the knitted fabric contains acrylic and started pilling a lot within the first week of wear. after a month and a couple washes, it looks horrible. it may be the worst case of pilling i\\'ve ever seen in a fabric. so so disappointed. it initially fit true to size but has stretched out a bit over time. I ordered the black and white pattern, which was ok. i got a small, but the shirt was very square - with a short and wide fit! i doubt an xs would have helped with such a boxy shirt. sent this one back. I loved the dress, but just not dressy enough after rethinking what i needed. very easy order and return. thanks! I was very shocked to receive this dress with a rusty zipper, looks like crusty white rust . see attached pictures. the dress fabric is very nice and i did try it on and it is a very nice fit, lined with a little stretch but my gosh what a cheap poor quality zipper that looks like it was old and exposed to moisture because the metal parts have a white crusty substance! retailer you really need to check your merchandise before sending to your loyal customers. lately the quality has been declining a Beautiful fabric! unfortunately, i had to return it. after just one wear, it had pills all over the side. fabric is too delicate. sad to return! This is a great feminine top i just wish it were a little bit longer for my taste, it hit about two inches below my belly button. it was a little snug around the belly area so that\\'s why i feel it runs small for the brand, usually the brand runs true to size but not for this top Lol on the previous comment about it being a poor man?s pineapple blouse. i think the pineapple blouse prints are too large on a petite person like me (i?m 5?2?), thus i prefer this blouse. i concur with the previous reviewer about getting makeup on the blouse due to the narrow collar. if you wear makeup like i do, you must find a trick to taking it on and off. for me, i put it on prior to putting on makeup (i even put tissue paper around the collar while putting on makeup, and don?t even think I tried on the 00p in the store as a return, adn though it would fit (super stretchy)hte dress ended up mid thigh for me... gorgeous design and make though, the buttoning is incredible, buttons and clasps to keep the dress closed. love love, wish htey still had my size (0p or 2p ) to try if hte length would be better (or regular size) The overall styling was great, and the dress is super-cute, if a little thick (it\\'s made of denim, after all). i ordered a size down from my normal, and even then, i was swimming in it. the worst part, and the aspect that will make me return it, is that the arm holes hang down so low that i\\'d have to wear a tank top under the dress. i\\'m returning it, though it is really cute and i love this brand. the arm holes killed it for me. These are the perfect higher waisted skinny jeans. high enough that there is no muffin top, but not so high they look like mom jeans. typical ag super soft fabric. they are like wearing sweat pants. so worth the extra money for the ag jeans. love the length too. These pants are more like 9\" not 10\". i was very dissappointed. the color is great and so is the fabric.\\r\\nif you look more closely at the model the pants don\\'t fit her either!! they are too small! i haven\\'t decided whether or not to take them back because i am losing weight. i am a 31 so far but these pants are like a 30. i need the color because they go perfectly with a top i bought from retailer I am 5.1 and 113lbs. i ordered the petite size 26 and it fits like a glove. i gave 4 starts as i wish i had less stretch in it but other than that they are perfect length and sooo soft. super happy with the cut and waist height! I ordered the blue dress because i loved the color and unique design. the blue was much more of a dark navy, not a sapphire blue as it looks in the picture. the picture also shows it tying on the side. it did not tie on the side when i tried it on but in the front as pictured in the red version of the dress. it was not at all flattering on me. one of the few disappointing things i have ordered from retailer. They\\'re great. i saw them featured in one of the marketing emails. they looked comfortable and cute, different with the leg warmer type bottom. i went to the retailer near me, but they didn\\'t have them in store. this was a slight disappointment because i wanted to try them on for sizing purposes. but, i ordered them because they were affordable, in the $30 range, cute, comfortable, and stylish. they also ended up fitting perfectly as well. nice job! The fabric is a nice weight knit and the top generally well made. unfortunately, the fit was enormous. i\\'ve an athletic build w/ big boobs & normally wear l in retailer tops. I am 5\\'8 154 pounds and ordered a medium. the coat is a bit bigger than expected and should have gone down a size. i\\'m keeping this size however because it is incredibly comfortable, roomy and perfect for mild winters. the wool does keep you warm in 50 degree weather. I loved the texture and look of this skirt. very classy. but it fits tight-- i usually take a 4 or 6 on skirts depending on where the waistband hits and i could barely squeeze into the 4 and could not get it zipped. i\\'d need to go a size bigger in this one but now it\\'s unavailable :( So, i bought these in 31 --my regular size in hei-hei and they were huge. so, now i am not sure if i should go for a 30 or 29? i guess i will try the 30. they are really soft and very cute pants. just the sizing is difficult. I was looking forward to receiving this dress. i am tired of all of the swing dresses - most of which are not flattering on my petite frame. i am also uncomfortable with dresses that fall much above the knee as i am somewhat older. the colors and fabric of this dress are beautiful. vibrant, but not too bright. when i got it on i was thrilled with the fit - until i looked at the back. there are pleats at the waist in back and there is way too much fabric. it looked like i had a bustle under the d I wanted to love this dress. i ordered an xsmall and a small. i am 5\\'6\" and 110 lbs, slender build. the xsmall fit great everywhere but the waist band was completely out of portion for the dress. both sizes will have to be returned. possibly if you have a more straight up and down figure it will fit better and pull in your waist! I\\'ve been looking for a nice summer maxi dress and after reading some positive reviews, i decided to get the dress. the fabric is soft and has a nice flow to it. however, i had to return the dress because the cuff of the sleeve was too tight on my forearm, which make it impossible for me to raise my arms.\\r\\n\\r\\ni ordered size petite xxs I was hoping these would be like some of the lace shorts i bought from retailer last year that i loved so much. sadly, no. first of all they run small. i am between a s and xs in most brands, bought a s in these because i like my shorts on the looser side. these felt a little snug and short, but i decided to keep them. the first time i washed them, they were ruined. i followed the directions exactly and even put them in a lingerie bag in the washer, plus a delicate cycle, no dryer. the lace is man Love this chemise. the lace detail is cute, the length of the skirt is longer than many of the night gowns you\\'d find in the cute, not frumpy category, and overall it is super soft and comfortable for lounging and sleeping. bought the large, and i\\'m normally around a size 8-10, between medium and large depending on the cut of the item. the large is slightly on the big size, so the straps move around when i sleep. not a big deal for me, so i kept it. I wished these fit a little better. unfortunately, they were a little tight in the thighs and if i didn\\'t pull the waist of the pants up, i had sagging crotch and the pockets hung out. needless to say i made a return. I wished these fit a little better. unfortunately, they were a little tight in the thighs and if i didn\\'t pull the waist of the pants up, i had sagging crotch and the pockets hung out. needless to say i made a return. Really cute piece, but it\\'s huge. i ordered an xxs petite and it was unfortunately extremely wide and not flattering. returning. After a long wait for this dress to come in. i finally received it! the wait was worth it!\\r\\n\\r\\nthe colors and pattern are just like they are online. the length comes right to to the top of my knees...i am 5\\'7\". a couple of things to note: the sleeves are narrow,. if you have skinny arms, no problem. the fit across the bust is snug enough that if you have a large bust, there will probably be a gap at the buttons. there are gathers at the shoulder giving the sleeve a slight puffed shoulder. if you Soft  stretch denim, 70\\'s fun vibe . i so wanted to keep this , but for me the sizing was off. i ordered a size 27, my usual denim jeans size . the waist down fit perfectly but i couldn\\'t zip the top portion. i fear that even if i order one size up which i believe would still be ok for the bottom half ; i still won\\'t have enough room from my rib cage to the top of the bib section. i had  a 3 inch gap  in that area\\r\\n. for full disclosure , i am a  size 36b  with broad shoulders and  a broad back I wanted to love this dress. i ordered online and what you cannot see in the picture if the pleating on the dress. i ordered a medium, i am usually a large in retailer and the medium looked like a tent. i realize this should be loose fitting but it was huge. I wanted to love this top -- looks so comfy and cute. but hangs like a bag. going back! I adore this sweater coat! i first bought the green color in my normal size online on a whim mostly due to the positive reviews. i was not disappointed at all! this sweater coat is soft boiled wool.. the green color is a deep forest that looks incredible with black, grays and berry colors.\\n\\nthe fit appears to be magical. it manages to be both roomy and figure flattering, which is tricky with my figure (hourglass). i tend to need a defined waist, but somehow this coat manages to be very slimming These pants are beautiful and very comfortable. i am 5\\'3\" and 120, ordered an extra small. i had to hem them because they are extremely long, otherwise the fit is great. Dress is beautiful in person, light material that is excellent for summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis dress is not forgiving in the chest, so ladies if you bigger chested i suggest going up a size or two. i\\'m 5\\'4, 145 lbs and 34ddd, i usually wear 8 or 10, this dress in a 10 made my look like i was wearing an unflattering sports bra. This t fits perfect and looks great with just about anything. my only concern is the fabric is super light. not enough to be see through, but just enough to make me question the quality. i like it and i have worn it a couple of times now with no issues though. the drape is nice and not super revealing; discreet enough for work. i ordered the white and if it holds up i will certainly order another color because it is very versatile. This is the cutest romper ever !! very high quality.. \\r\\nit has always been a challenge for me to find and love rompers. but this fit beautifully.\\r\\ni cant wait to wear it this summer. I was surprised retailer decided to ship this sweater. the sweater looks like it\\'s falling apart and it is huge. i would not recommend this even at a clearance price. I\\'m a fan of yumi kim dresses and consistently wear size small. so, i ordered this in a small, and the top was a little loose, but it was way too short. there\\'s no way i would feel comfortable wearing this in public. i\\'m 5\\'7\", and the hem was higher than mid-thigh on me. the waist is also billowy and has no defined shape. Normally a 28, and on a fluke i dragged the 27 to the fitting room. the 27 hung better that the 28.\\n\\ni have a belly, but not much in the hips, so this was surprising. most things are too tight in the waist.\\n\\ndenim feels very soft. they may not last, but it\\'s like butter. Awful color, horribly wrinkled and just a mess...so disappointed This is a beautiful blouse however it runs big. i order the small and had to return it. my measurements are 5\\'4 135 34c-28-38 for reference. you will not regret buying this blouse but it has to be the right size if not it would look like it did on me, frumpy. i kept taking it off and putting it back on trying to make it work (because i liked the material that much) but if you look at the model she has her arms straight down. when i lifted my arms i had 3 inches of extra material on both side. th This is a pretty dress, although it runs smaller and the colors aren\\'t as vibrant as on the website. the waist ran very small for me in a size 10 which is my normal size and normally runs looser in the waist area as i have an hour glass figure. this probably will look very nice on someone smaller. These relaxed fit jeans are super soft. they do run a size large, i am a size 26 in the stilt style and the 25 in these fit well with a little \"room\". I thought i would love this shirt because it goes along with my style, but i returned it immediately. it runs so large! the colors are faded, and the trim of the shirt curl over, so it looks cheap and frumpy. i do not recommend this! it hits in all the wrong places. There are darts that are not shown in this picture that make the dress ill fitted. not sure why they are not in the picture and on the dress. i wish the pictures shown were more accurate. I just received the pink in the mail. i am 5\\' 5\" and around 140. i ordered the size 29, they fit perfectly. they are a very straight leg with a snug fit. you can adjust the cuff to whatever length you need or unroll them completely. the fabric is of beautiful quality. i basically never wear corduroy because it can add pounds. not so with this pair of pants. i am thinking about another color!! I bought this very cute t-shirt in sky. wore it once, then washed it according to the washing instuctions (machine washable/dryable). this t-shirt turned into a crop top!!!!! i can\\'t wear it. it\\'s going to goodwill. i would suggest that you air dry this shirt, if you want to take the chance that it won\\'t shrink up several inches. Hahaha..this dress is hilarious! it looks nothing like the image! i am usually a 0/xs, and 4 was the smallest size available, so i ordered it. when i opened it, it felt like 10 lbs of fabric. i thought maybe i ordered a size way too big, until i could barely squeeze into the top of the dress. once i looked in the mirror, i almost fell over laughing. the rest of the dress is huge. i don\\'t believe this dress would be flattering on anyone. Love tanks and this one is sweet and flowy. great with jeans/shorts or slacks with a jacket for the office. beautiful yellow floral with fun straps in the back that you can wear with a bra. front neckline is cut narrow so bra straps show but with nude or plastic straps it\\'s not that big a deal. I also expected this sweater to have more bulk to it per the images. it is very thin as others have said. the design is awkward with the sleeve placement and that makes it more flowy vs. structured. it is more similar to a cape or shawl design. if you;\\'re looking for a warm cozy blanket sweater design, this is not it. i will keep it though as a layering piece and because of the sale price and classic color design. This dress has been in my inbox for a long time and when it went on sale i purchased it right away. i am a size 4 petite in everything retailer and have not had a problem with fit, if anything i might have to size down. i purchased a 4 petite in this dress and i couldn\\'t zip it all the way up. it was as if i was trying to get into a 0 petite.  i don\\'t even think a size 6 would fit. there is something not right with the make of this particular dress i received. even if the fit was perfect i didn\\'t I fell in love instantly...but...upon looking in the mirror, it is 100 percent see through. at least the black is... i love it enough that i am going to try to put a cami underneath. however, that mayn\\'t work. the shirt is lovely in and of itself, but at 48, i don\\'t need a see through shirt. it is also defiantly about a size larger that expected. so size down. almost so good! Fits large, wrinkles easily and not what i expected for the price. These are my first pilcro. love the tuxedo seam and notch at the side, and the noni green is a verstaile, yet unusual green. thicker soft cotton with just 3% spandex.\\n.\\nordered sizes 25, 26 and 27 regular which are a perfect full length for me. i\\'m 5\\'2\", currently 33-25-37, longwaisted and pear shape. i wear a 26 in ag stevie cords which are snug first, then stretch to a perfect size and often a size 27 in their less stretchy stevie jeans.\\n.\\nin these the 27 were so big at the waist that they sli I ordered the yellow color way expecting it to be a mustard color. it seemed to have a greenish tint to it and didn\\'t look right on me. also the pockets didn\\'t lay right so the flower didn\\'t look right. I thought i\\'d like this dress in the neutral color. i had to return it it as it was quite unflattering. the skirt made my hips look big and the uneven shape didn\\'t help. the top fit well, in my usual 4 petite, i think it would look nice on some people, as it\\'s something different but i am not one of those it worked on. Several months ago i bought the byron lars pieced brocade dress (size 10) it\\'s a little large through the torso area but with the belt it fits good enough. since i have loved this dress so much i wanted another byron lars dress so i bought the carissima sheath and the sunrose dress both in a 10. they both were way too big so i ordered a size 8 and they both just barely fit ??? oh was i disappointed....so one more try, i ordered this dress the allusione sheath size 10, and yepeee it fits perfect These pants are more like 9\" not 10\". i was very dissappointed. the color is great and so is the fabric.\\r\\nif you look more closely at the model the pants don\\'t fit her either!! they are too small! i haven\\'t decided whether or not to take them back because i am losing weight. i am a 31 so far but these pants are like a 30. i need the color because they go perfectly with a top i bought from retailer This top is really cute and true to size. i like the color and the nice details. I would have loved this sweater if it were true to the picture but the stripes are gray, not white. either i got a strange one or (as happens to me sometimes with retailer) the pictures are very misleading. disappointed because i wanted to love this. I ordered my normal size large and it fit well although a bit on the long side. the fabric has a waffle texture that\\'s lightweight but warm and cozy. i got the blue and the color was a bit intense in combination with the tie dye affect and waffled texture. my favorite part are the lighter striations on the neck. that opening is really small. it just didn\\'t suit me, so i returned but recommend giving it a try if it\\'s calling your name. This top doesn\\'t at all fit like it does on the model. the mid section is very wide and boxy and the material is thick and almost sweatshirt-like. i typically wear size small or 4, but perhaps an xs might\\'ve fit or looked better. sadly i must return this shirt. I bought both the small and the medium and seem to be right in between. the small is a tad tight through the shoulders and arms, but the medium feels a bit baggy. it is soft and hangs nicely - i just need to figure out if i will wear it enough to justify the price. This top is very cute. but the middle seam in off center near the bottom and cause the top to twist while wearing it. that is annoying. Love the look of this and the fabric, but runs way small. i usually wear a 0. ordered the 0, then 2. just got the 4 and it\\'s still too small. will be returning all 3. This dress is very beautiful and looks great on, however had to downsize one size. Cup size is really small for a medium. no way to adjust the back strap. ended up giving it to my daughter. cute but so poorly executed. These pants are so soft and super comfy.\\r\\nthey look great with heels and sandals. \\r\\nthey will be my go to this summer for sure.\\r\\nwould love them in black or navy. These pants are nothing short of amazing! they have a great wide leg with plenty of beautiful flow to them. i am 6 months pregnant and can wear them under my bump, but they are by no means maternity pants (i have only gained 8 lbs). they have a nice silky material that will be great for hot summer weather and will be great, comfortable travel pants. the only downfall is the length. i am 5\\'6\" with long legs and will have to get 2-3 inches chopped off. This is a great beach/pool or lounge piece. i debated keeping but couldn\\'t pass up how comfortable it was. hugging without being tight. i will probably only wear it with some sort of layer like a jean jack or tied shirt rather than undone unless on on the beach but it\\'s so comfortable. straps are a bit long. I honestly, have to give these jeans 5stars.  i loved them when i saw them in the store and had to have them and when i wore them, i got tons of compliments. they are super comfortable too!  i read some of the other reviews and thought that their comments were a little strange.  these jeans are obviously not classic and they will go of style but, if you run a little outside of the style box you will welcome them in your wardrobe. I was drawn to this top because of the interesting and detailed straps, which are embroidered with a lovely triangle pattern. however the embroidery takes away any stretchy-ness or give in the cotton and makes the top a beautiful but ill-fitting harness for anyone with any breasts or full-figured lusciousness. the worst part is that the top hem along the top is embroidered and rigid just like the straps, so it feels like you are wearing an uncomfortable strapless top. i wanted to keep this but h I\\'m a big retailer buyer- and usually love the dresses, especially the petite xs maxis. this was the worst retailer purchase i have ever made. \\r\\n\\r\\nit was humongous and gave me no shape. even if i purchased an xxsp it probably would be the same. i\\'m small but i mean come on- this would only fit a giantess-- which also makes no sense because it\\'s the petite size. \\r\\n\\r\\ndo not buy. i\\'m very upset i have to pay the $5.95 return fee since i ordered this. If you haven\\'t yet joined the jumpsuit bandwagon, now is the time! this jumpsuit is absolutely stunning! classy, elegant and a stand out piece. i purchased at full price. i have a hard time with jumpsuits as i am quite tall and they usually look like an adult onsie on me - this jumpsuit made me feel beautiful, put together and graceful. i cannot recommend it enough! fit is true to size, i am a 4 and purchased the 4. not too short in the crotch and i am almost 5\\'10. form fitting but still a bit f Tried these on several times in store and never bought them, but was able to get them with a 20% email- seemed like a better price for the product. the color is rust and a little odd for my wardrobe - wish they also came in black. love the style and they are very comfortable, perfect for late summer- can wear on errands or dress them up a little with shoes/accessories for casual dinner out. happy i finally purchased them! This is so thin and poor quality. especially for the price. it felt like a thin pajama top. the buttons are terrible little shell buttons. this could not have been returned faster. Bought this on a whim and it exceeded my expectations. i didn\\'t know what to expect with the quality of the fabric but this is incredibly soft and warm. haven\\'t worn it outside yet but i can see this already as one of my favorite items. i\\'m usually an extra-small but the xxs also fits. it\\'s a great buy especially since it\\'s on sale now. I purchased this top in the store, intending only to go in and return two tops i purchased on sale that did not fit. i had been looking for a red top to wear with navy, and this one couldn\\'t have looked more perfect on the hanger. from the front, it looks pretty traditional, but the back is just gorgeous! the multi-colors and the pleating give the top a lot of interest and depth. the fabric is also super soft and comfortable. the top does run quite large, though, as i purchased an xs and still h This is an attractive shirt but runs big. i ordered the black and white. Really liked the color but the style was too cropped and boxy for me. this sweater was short, wide and unflattering. however, i like this designer so i ordered another style with a different silhouette. The shirt is very big. it would be cute as a maternity shirt. Such a pretty fall sweater. nice fit. wore it once out shopping and it snagged :( had to return, sadly. I loved the print and fabric of this dress when i first saw it, but trying it on was a very different story! the photo seems to show a wider, more well-defined waist, with just a small amount of \"blousing\" on top, but this was not the case. yes, the waist fit, but it is a narrow band that was covered completely by the hanging over of the ill-fitting top, turning the entire look into a shapeless and very unattractive fit. sadly, this is going right back! I am a sucker for a peasant dress. i love anything i can toss with a pair flats and head out the door, but this dress is ridiculous. i look like a schoolmarm. the white bib collar takes this dress into costume territory. i love one september and have many items from the brand that i wear regularly, so i\\'m bummed that this wasn\\'t what i expected. i knew it would have flow, but it\\'s more billowy than i wanted. stay away unless you want to look like a little girl on the first day of school. Love this tank, i am petite and this was the perfect length for me, i wore it with white jeans and a blazer.  love the print! I\\'m a petite so as usual i have to order from retailer. i saw this on line and tried it on in a regular size in the store. even though of course it didnt fit, the style of the tee was nice so i ordered it. i couldnt have been more disappointed when i received it. the quality was truly awful. i\\'m not even sure why it is being sold. the neckline was warped and wouldn\\'t lie flat again the neck or chest; the bottom hem was crooked. it was really bad. also having purchased tees in similar material befo This shirt is super comfortable and super chic. it looks great and feels great. Purchased this should in the blue motif in size small. i am usually between a small and medium in shirts, 36c broad shoulders. the fit was fine in the small. however, i had a few issues with the top: 1) the blue motif looked actually like a faded blue (as if it had been washed quite a few times and looked worn), 2) the front mid/bottom section laid strangely and gave me a maternity look, and 3) the back has alot of fabric (see back of tank in white motif) and was very voluminous. for me, it wasn Wanted to love this.. love rompers, but the opening between your chest was oddly designed, it was gapping and certainly couldn\\'t bend over without showing lots.. fabric seemed heavy for the summer. all in all it was too full, made me feel frumpy.. I love this top, beautiful soft fabric , much prettier than picture, can be worn on or off shoulders. extremely flattering, falls to a perfect length , great with shorts, pants or a long skirt. These ag stevie ankle jeans only have 50% cotton.tthe rest is 41% lyocell (a rayon), 7% polyester, and 2% polyurethane. result: thin and clingy jeans that show every lump, and stretch out. \\r\\n.\\r\\nthese are no longer the same lovely ags in twill when they were at 80% cotton, 18% modal, 2% pu. it seems ag has also stopped making denim and corduroy with 98% cotton, at least in the stevies.\\r\\n.\\r\\ni\\'m sure these will be a great choice for someone looking for very soft and thin pants that feel like pjs, b I really like this top. perfect underneath cardigans or on its own. the fabric is a bit thin so light colors may be see through. love the wider style so there is no bra show. versatile. i see myself purchasing more of these! I\\'m 5\\' 5\", 150 lbs, 32dd, normally a 28p or 29p in pants. i ordered an 8 and probably should have gone with a 10. it was super unflattering?the print was overwhelming for my pale skin, it made my thin waist look larger than it really was, and rode up the inside of my thighs. i have a similar bathing suit from modcloth that\\'s 1/3 of the price and 20x as flattering. if you have thick legs, this may not be the suit for you. i returned it--so fast. I also returned this dress after waiting weeks to received it.  i had high hopes for this dress as i really loved it online but what a disappointment when i got it.  the fabric is made of cheap poly that\\'s shiny, thin, and clingy.  it shows every lump and bump you have.  the zipper at the back won\\'t lay flat and keeps bunching up creating an ugly bump.  the sewing and hemline is uneven.  there wasn\\'t a lot of thought put in in the print placement where the seams was sewn together in the midline Very comfortable,  looks great on. like the color & fabric. something you can throw on & go This looks cute on the model but was way too big, loose and sloppy for me. i probably needed a petite size. i ordered a regular xs, but returned it. it is an okay black top, nothing great. I should preface this by saying that i\\'m in between sizes. i chose the smaller size and found that this top is not super forgiving. i\\'m keeping it bc it is good quality and i like the style, but i wouldn\\'t be comfortable wearing it right now! maybe after i lose a few pounds! I love this coat but it does not work for my body type. it is a beautiful coat and of very good quality. it has a wonderful lining which is so nice to see as many of the \"coats\" retailer is carrying right now are not lined. the coat is soft and feels so good. it seems to run true to size. i would have purchased this if the button placement were higher up. the button closure is right at my hips ( i am 5\\'6\" for reference) and i am pretty curvy. when open, the coat looked great but when i trie Absolutely love the cut and design of these pants! fit so well and unique pattern at the ankle however, as is the case with many white pants, so disappointed when i tried them on at home and could see my underwear (nude color!) the pants are beautiful in every way except that they need to be lined! going back - may order the black since they\\'re not likely to be \"see through!\" disappointing! was hoping to wear them to a dinner party! First one i received was ripping apart already in the sleeve opening at wrist (warning: very tight sleeves!), plus 2\" of the green shiny band detail was missed altogether by whomever sewed this particular one- just left unstitched. and long threads were hanging in several places. this is by no means a quality piece and is severely overpriced. on the positive side, it is very cute and i\\'m keeping the replacement one, but know that it is also delicate. after one use, there is a snag on the inside I love everything about this except the length. i am short and usually order a petite and even this is really cropped on me. the quality is good, thick and substantial, color is great but very cropped and sleeves are long on me as well. just weird proportions so sadly, going back. I love this dress! it\\'s super comfortable--soft fabric and doesn\\'t bind anywhere--yet somehow it\\'s still feminine and sexy. i get compliments on it wherever i go! also, it works all year-round (in winter it can be easily paired with boots, tights, a long-sleeved black t-shirt, etc.). I was intrigued by the pattern of this blouse (the purple version) but the design is terrible for me. it\\'s boxy, i didn\\'t like the fabric, and the arm ruffles are bizarre. it\\'s going back tomorrow. When i got this top in the mail i was impressed by the colors. they were very vibrant and i loved the feel of the material as well. however the top did not look good on. i have an hourglass figure with a dd+ bust, and the peplum just made me look like i didn\\'t have a waist. the arm holes were also very big and showed my bra. overall i think this is a very cute top, but would probably be better on women with more athletic figures. This was a very odd fitting top. i should have read the description more closely. the colors are beautiful but the cut hit me in all the wrong places. It\\'s embarrassing to admit but i am buying this top for the second time because i\\'ve misplaced the first one and i fear that if i wait too long trying to recover it that it will be a sold out item and i\\'ll never be able to have it again... hence the decision to repurchase. i just love it that much. i\\'m sure that now that i have the second top the first one will mysteriously show up, lol!\\r\\n\\r\\nanyway, this top is a very flattering off the shoulder style. one of the things i really like about it is I don\\'t typically write bad reviews, but this dress is so bad and i want to save someone else from buying it. i read the mostly bad reviews and still purchased anyway (my fault i know). the dress is super stiff ( i know denim can be that way and it is possible it would soften up after a few washes). i\\'m typically a 6/8 and the size small swallowed me, and the xs was big everywhere except through the bust (i ordered both sizes to try). i wouldn\\'t recommend buying this if you are a size 8 or small I love the style of this coat and the way it fits on the model. in reality, the cut is more straight. i was hoping for some darting and a slimmer silhouette. cinching the belt makes the coat bunch unattractively. if i sized down, i think it would look better but i\\'m concerned that my shoulders will not fit. the fabric is 60% poly/40% wool and a bit itchy where it\\'s not lined. the lining is a jersey poly blend. the belt has flimsy ugly string loops that cheapens look of the coat. other than the b This sweater is thicker and darker than it appears online. i thought it would be more of a blush color, but it\\'s more dark gray and brown. it wasn\\'t that flattering on me as a cardigan. looked a little cuter all buttoned up, but ultimately i am not keeping because of the color. Agree with above review. these are described totally wrong. they are not 8.5 rise. they are very high rise, so much that i didnt even try them on...the color isnt good either, it looks like a cheap levi\\'s color or just not a quality denim. if you like high rise, you might like them. i can\\'t comment on fit.. I love this dress! i was actually able to fit in a l versus my usual xl due to the style of the dress. a bigger chest person (i\\'m a d) may not find the dress as well fitting as i do. overall great fit can easily dress it warm with a scarf, boots, hat or best. a great dress for fall-spring Those pants sit pretty snug on top and get very wide very fast. this looks odd in my opinion if you do not wear a tunic style top like on the picture. also the material is quite thin, which makes the snug part look unflattering. they were not for me unfortunately. Bought in white. it has a ribbed detail that makes ir only for casual wear.  the white is pretty sheer. will return. I love the way these jeans look and fit, but they have a chemical smell. i assumed the odor would go away after i washed them, but it doesn\\'t seem to have helped. I had loved this on-line when i saw the pretty floral pattern. however, in person, it is such a disappointment. the quality of the fabric and the fit are just very poor. I absolutely adore this top! it is so versatile and looks equally beautiful with jeans as with dressier, skinny pants. i bought this to wear for our holiday photos and have gotten so much use out of it. worth every penny. i have just ordered the blue version and cannot wait to get it. I was very surprised to see such dark blue sequence on this dress. it did not appear as it did on the photo. i was pretty disappointed by the color. the photo of the dress is much more impressive. The fabric and its texture didn\\'t meet my expectations unfortunately. there were too much fray and cast-off of edge yarns of a fabric... \\r\\nhowever this will fit if you wear over the swimming wears. I\\'m 5\\'3\" 115 lbs and ordered an xs petite. i have other dresses from maeve in xs petite and xxs petite that fit really well, but this one was weirdly big at the top This sweater looks great with chambray colored denim. i wear it with jeans, shift dresses and even leggings. definitely one of my go to sweaters for the fall. I bought a size small in this dress even though i am usually a large at retailer. it just hung strangely and clung to the unflattering parts of my body but seemed very large. i loved the feel, color (grey) and style of the dress, but i ended up returning it because of the fit. it also requires something under it since it is fairly see-through. The sleeve detail is cute and well done. the fabric is nice quality, but the body of the shirt really doesn\\'t have any shape. I have wanted a boiled wool jacket for years. finally. i got the gray/navy. soft, warm and classic. i expect it to last forever. it is the right weight for out door wear in warmer climates or late fall/early spring in minnesota. the sleeves are long, but push up nicely, and roomy enough to go over a long sleeved blouse. i paired it with the tartan charlie trousers, and it is very polished for work. soft. but someone sensitive to wool might find it itchy. i agree that it is a little boxy--but i t This simple lace top is beautiful and easy to wear, but do not wash it. the hem completely fell apart for me! As soon as i pulled these pants from their packaging, i feel in love with them. the fabric was so soft - i could not wait to get them on...yeah, that was not going to happen! i could not pull them on - not even a little bit! these pants run incredibly small. i ordered them twice: once in my regular size, and again in a larger size. unfortunately, i am sized out of these beauties. When i saw this item online, i ordered it right away. loved the color and the oversized, comfy look to it. the pros: very soft,the color a deep cranberry as pictured. the cons; the low back - in the photo, the model\\'s arms cover it up. when i put it on, it looked like an oversized flap that stuck out on the sides and was very visible from the front -- and because the material is unstructured, that made it look worse. i loved it except for this one feature, but because it was so detracting, i had So disappointing! everything i\\'ve owned from bordeaux has washed well and stood the test of time. one wash and this was ruined! shrunk terrible even after washing in cold water on delicate and laying flat to dry. completely ruined. returned it. This sweater is gorgeous in print but in person the colors are murkier. the yellow dots are really a dusty mustard yellow and the navy is a smokey navy. the white background reads more oatmeal in person. Ordered this dress in an xs, that is the size i usually wear. this runs small, but not only that it is the way it is cut, very small through the hips, thighs and legs. hard to walk in it. the material felt kind of cheap to me. i thought it looked really good on the model, but got it home and didn\\'t like it at all! it went back! Beautiful and good quality dress. the pictures nor the description really show or mention the keyhole cut at the front neckline.  you really have to look very closely at the model photos to see it.  unlike the model, i have curves and this dress showed way too much cleavage for me. These pants are awesome! very light weight and will be great for spring/summer. now if only the sunshine will get here and melt away all of this snow!\\n\\ni also purchased the top pictured on the model, it is super cute with this outfit and can work with so many different looks. check it out!\\n\\nthey run big, i would definitely consider sizing down or ordering two sizes to try on. Beautiful color, design and fit.  but i couldn\\'t wait to get it off.  i don\\'t have sensitive skin and don\\'t recall ever putting a jacket on that felt like steel wool. This dress looks nothing like the photo. the sequins are dull, no sheen at all. the faux leather panels and straps look and feel like cheap, shiny plastic. i didn\\'t even try it on, because it was so hideous, when i pulled it out of the box. not remotely worth the price and wouldn\\'t buy it on sale for $20 either. skip. I saw this top online and ordered immediately!\\r\\ni loved the color, lace, and unique details.\\r\\nsadly it just arrived and it is a disaster!\\r\\nthe lace is stiff and doesn\\'t lay softly, and is very rough against your skin.\\r\\nthe style ( and i like shorter style tops) is extremely boxy and the sleeves protrude outwards in a funny way.,.....\\r\\nthat although i am so in love with this color, i would be embarrassed to wear this top in public.\\r\\nit could have been fantastic, if the lace was softer, and some a I bought this top in black. it is high quality material and i love the mock neck and zipper in back.  however, not only are the armholes are too large, the shirt is cut too short. if i size down for smaller armholes, it becomes a crop top, not a flattering look for 50-something me. i really wanted this to work, but alas, it went back. Appears much more sleek in the photograph. in real life, this shirt looks more like a pajama top. thin, extremely casual, not worth the price i paid- even in black. will be exchanging it tomorrow. This suit is absolutely gorgeous but it really will only fit a very short waisted gal. it fit perfectly in the body and in the bust but just was not long enough for me to lift my arms up and my size c cup boobs to not pop out. i was very sad to return it :( i am a size 8 with c cup boobs and ordered it in a medium I ordered this shirt online without seeing it in person, and it is great! it is true to size (if not slightly loose fitting) and a thick cottony-material with a pretty design. could be nice for spring, summer, or even fall with a cardigan. I love the colors of the teal dress, but i wish that the top only had one color. the design is cute but the construction is a little off. the transition from the top to the skirt seems to lay wrong or have a bit of extra fabric. sizing up or down didn\\'t help. the top is lined but the bottom is very thin. the bottom should be lined too. not the best. The fabric was a beautiful color, but the material and seams were not well put together. the elastic in the arm was stretched before i tried on the dress so the sleeves did not fit well. i unfortunately ended up returning. These socks were so narrow, especially on top, that they pinched my thighs and we\\'re almost painful to wear all day. my thighs are pretty narrow, i\\'m only five feet tall and my legs and hips are the thinnest part of my body. i understand that they need to be reinforced on top so that they don\\'t slip down but these are definitely made for a person who is unhealthily skinny. \"one size\" is definitely not true. they also snag easily. I loved the fit, color and style, but the fabric seemed very thin and cheap. i was worried that it would tear easily. this is getting returned. I bought this unique beauty in a size 0. the fit was superb and without compromise. the ascetics are incomparable, as well as the quality. the most stunning dress i have purchased from retailer in quite a while! I wasn\\'t sure about this top but i had a feeling i needed to at least try it on. it drapes so beautifully and the keyhole neck is a lovely little touch. i love the asymmetric hemline and the fabric is incredibly soft. as far as the fit goes i found that it did run slightly small. I went with the xs because i didn\\'t want the v neck in the front to be too low. it looks cute paired with a kimono and a necklace. For me, at 5\\'9\", the top was not long enough...it appeared longer in the photo. i\\'ll be returning it. other than length, it is cute. I love love this sweater it\\'s beautiful on and super comfy. my only complaint is that it had a snag and a hole in the back. so i can\\'t say it\\'s good quality. The shirt cuts too high up and is very awkward looking on. sent it back. wouldn\\'t buy even on sale. This is a beautiful dress. however, it looked awful on me. i ordered the medium and it was huge. also, i looked 7 months pregnant. not a good style for the short person. I passed over this dress online thinking i\\'d never wear it. but, then i found myself inside an retailer store and decided to try it on. i am excited to say that i love this dress. it is soft and lovely. the cowl is large and the whole dress has a really great drape. my favorite thing is that the buttons along the back are functional. opening up the back turns this dress into a long cardigan that is to die for. I was really disappointed when i tried this top on. the design and cut of the neckline is very bulky and just off. the cut of the top overall was just off. Once or twice a year, retailer dons out a true 80s masterpiece!  the sweater is sturdy, bright and bold. quality and craftsmanship are amazing and the fit is tts!  i cannot wait for the cooler weather to wear this beauty with some skinny jeans!! Feminine but not too fussy tee is a nice linen-like material. i got the white one which will go with a lot of my skirts, pants and shorts. unlike other reviewers, i didn\\'t find it too short for me at all, but i am high-waisted. casual but with extras. This is really cute online, but is not fantastic on or in person. this is a top that i may be returning. i love the open shoulder, but the material is very thin, and the top runs large. it also hangs really low in the back which i am not a huge fan of. This is a darling dress!  it is super flattering . . . except if you are a swimmer and have broad shoulders.  unfortunately i had to return it because it pulled so tightly across my shoulders/chest.  i ordered a size 4 and it was actually true to size other than failing to accomodate for an athletic upper body.  i\\'m 5\\'4\", 118 lbs.  wish i could have kept this one! Not sure why this shirt is getting bad reviews. i am tall and have a long torso, so perhaps that is the issue for some who find it not so flattering? maybe if your taller it hangs better? i have to say... i love everything about it. it is a fantastic print, it is very flowy but i don\\'t think it\\'s too much in that regard. i think it is fitting with the romantic, girly style of the garment. in my opinion not too short, just right. i took a medium, i am 5\\'8\" and athletic. Nice weight and loved the design, but the inside was what i loved the most. it doesn\\'t show in the photos, but the zipper is a light blue and the fabric is double-sided, so the inside is lined with light blue flowers on a darker blue background. cute detail! the only drawback was the length of the sleeves. they were about 2\" too long...and i have long arms! there wasn\\'t enough stretch in band of the sleeve to keep them up once you pushed them up. the only other option i came up with was to fold I was so disappointed with the quality of this dress, especially because it looks so beautiful on the model. the fabric was so thin that after one hand wash, it\\'s already developing a tiny hole and pilling. also, it is definitely not a \"day dress\"--i wore it as a swim coverup, but it is much too thin and pajama-like to be worn as an actual dress. the color is much different in person--the blue is brighter and, for lack of a better way to describe it, cheap looking. the white banding around the t This dress looked adorable online, but unfortunately, it\\'s not flattering at all, and it\\'s completely see-through. completely. the material is so thin that i can\\'t imagine it would hold up very well over time. this one is definitely going back. I remember the first time i walked into an retailer store: like walking into a dream of all my favorite things. i\\'ve finally found a store whose products help me to express myself. as a writer, i love whimsical & out of the ordinary. i have found my honey hole. every time one of the pastel bags w/ribbon handles is past over the counter or i push \\'add to cart\\' on my computer, i do a little happy dance in my heart. my closet is like a candy store filled with sweets & treats. thank you retailerp This skirt could not be more comfortable. and the colors are great--nice and vibrant. i got compliments on it the first day i wore it. the only problem is it fits larger than i thought it would--it\\'s really stretchy fabric too. i\\'m a little curvy on the bottom and am short waisted, so i opted for a medium. i should have ordered the small. but it still works.\\n\\nthe other thing that\\'s nice is that for short people like me (i\"m between 5\\'2\" and 5\\'3\") it doesn\\'t drag on the ground; in fact it fits me First of all, the label on this dress is maeve, not nue by shani. second, i just wasn\\'t impressed. the fabric is cool...it has a sort of embossed look to it and it\\'s somewhat shiny, which sets it apart in a good way. but the cut is just boring. the top felt dowdy to me...overall, i was underwhelmed by this dress and returned it. Did not work for me. whatsoever. the stripes were adorable but the piece just didn\\'t fit like on the model. the collar was practically choking me and the tie just didn\\'t make my figure look the way it normally does. aka i looked frumpy and chunky, which i\\'m not. going back. I love the perfect length of these! i am 5\\'6\" and i love subtle capris which are very hard to find (unless i tailor them of course) but these are the perfect length and the color is great i have worn them twice and was stopped over and over again by people asking who made them. new favorite!! the waist runs a little tight but legs and tush are true to size!! I had hoped this bulky knit would be cuddly and soft, with suri (a type of alpaca) in the title. i don\\'t know if the blend (45% polyamide, 25% royal baby alpaca, 20% fine merino) threw it, but had i felt this in store, i would never have even picked it up. unimpressed. Love this shirt. i can dress it up or down. great fit I wanted to love this top, but had 2 major problems with it. first, it\\'s not for short girls. i\\'m only 5\\' tall and it was a total mess on me proportion wise. the sleeves were way too long and the seam where the sweater and peplum meet hit right in the middle of my butt, which was terribly unflattering. second, the grey fabric was very thin and kinda cheap looking. no regrets on returning this one. The perfect pair. i am 5\\'6\". 130lb, and ordered size 28, and it fits just right. it is a little stretchy, so molds to your shape. the legs are slender, but not too fitted. no stitching along the seems makes these jeans classy enough to work with a dressy shirt. I bought these last year and loved them, however they came in tall sizes. this year they do not and the inseam is just way too short, even at 33\". im 5\\'7\" and  they barely graze the floor with no break in the pant leg. i prefer to wear them with boots and they will not be long enough even with a short heal When i tried these on in the store in my size, but thought they felt tight, but the person helping me pointed out that they hug you, but are not uncomfortable. i uncuff the bottom and wear them full-length. ended up buying one of each color. Cropped and wide- would look cuter on someone who is more petite. was too wide and cropped for me. very sheer. This dress is beautiful and i received so many compliments. it\\'s form fitting but comfortable. it is just the right mix of classy and sexy. you can easily dress it up for a formal occasion or keep it simple. i am 5\\'6\", 150lb with an athletic build and a size 8 fit perfectly. i will be wearing this dress for years to come. I have to confess i had very high hopes for this dress. i was buying it as a stylish, modern alternative to a business suit. i wanted this dress to work as a piece to deliver presentations in or attend faculty functions. tailored, conservative, and edgy at the same time. several hundred dollars dress should meet the aforementioned needs, i thought. but it did not. the best description for the dress is \"blah\", average.\\n\\nthe material is textures and crinkly, not slick. the top is cream/ivory color I love, love, love this top! the color is beautiful, a pinkish-orange, about exactly how it looks online. it is soft and light weight for summers. it does run a little big, i debated between a 0 and a 2 and ended up with a 2, i\\'m almost 5\\'7\" and 130lbs for reference. it wings out on the sides at first, once i steamed it at home and relaxed the fabric a bit it draped nicely, so don\\'t let that turn you off from it when trying it on! part of the design is cut out through out as a warning, It was love at first sight. the only problem was that it didn\\'t come in my size. i took a chance and order a size smaller and it worked out great. its a great item that can be worn in the spring and fall. exactly what i was looking for. I own the green version of this jacket and ordered the ivory as well because of the sale price and because i loved the green one so much. i highly recommend this jacket to wear over dresses, with jeans or skirts all year round! Just received pants and even though they are labeled \"petite\" they are not. the inseam is 28 for a waist size 26, which is not what the description states. Runs a little small in the shoulders/bust Not as cute as photos, and too small in chest. i am 5\\'5\\'\\', 125 lbs, and the small was too tight in the chest, and i am not large here at all. shoulders and sleeve length fit well. will return. not comfortable, and will need to be able to button it on rainy days. I tried this dress on in the store. i loved the fabric and color, but the fit was huge, no matter how much i sized down. there are full dresses and tunics that are supposed to be loose, but this was shapeless in an unflattering way. i was attracted to the style and color, but the execution left much to be desired. As much as i buy from retailer, this is my first review. the pictures do not accurately show how large this dress is in person. i wanted something that was a bit flowy, but this was a reminder of little house on the prairie. the most unflattering dress ever and since it\\'s only available online, i\\'m not interested enough to try a smaller size. Nice weight and loved the design, but the inside was what i loved the most. it doesn\\'t show in the photos, but the zipper is a light blue and the fabric is double-sided, so the inside is lined with light blue flowers on a darker blue background. cute detail! the only drawback was the length of the sleeves. they were about 2\" too long...and i have long arms! there wasn\\'t enough stretch in band of the sleeve to keep them up once you pushed them up. the only other option i came up with was to fold I ordered these along with the regular ag stevie jeans and there is a definite difference in fabiric and cut. i liked the darker fabric but it was thinner and stretchier that the more \"denim\" version. the cut was also looser in the thigh and seat area which made for a looser, less flattering fit. returned it and kept the regular ag stevie. Great fabric, details, construction...but, it is not grey!! definitely shades of brown!! i do like the look & style of this top. I was so in love with this dress when i saw it in the store but so disappointed when i put it on. i am 5\\'10\" with curves and usually buy a large in dresses. this dress looked like a sack on me. the top was way too big and loose making the dress a boxy cut rather than a maxi cut like i was expecting. the dress is lovely to look at on the hanger and feels good on but i don\\'t think it flatters hourglass figures. it was the right length for me unlike many other reviewers. \\r\\nobviously, based off the Beautiful dress! flowers and material look even better in person. loose fit. This open cardigan runs really big and has way too much fabric. even going down a size i felt like i was swimming in it. What an adorable and frustrating skirt! i\\'m not a large person: 32d-26-36. and i ordered my normal size small. this is a pull on skirt, and the waist opening could not accommodate either my shoulders or my hips. in most retailer clothes, i\\'m either a size 2 or 4; i have to agree with the other reviewer. there is no way to put this item on. I own many retailer dresses but the sizing can be odd. i usually wear a size 4-6 and i have a floreat maxi dress size 4 that works well. i am 34c and based on the reviews i decided to order a size 6. the dress fits well except for he bust area that is very snug/couldn\\'t even get the zipper up. i will probably have to order a size 10 to be able to close the zipper on the bust area but it will be huge everywhere else.the fabric seems very delicate and may develop runs easily. it\\'s a shame because th This dress is gorgeous with fine detailing, and even though i\\'m curvier than the model, it still fits well and is flattering (please see attached poor quality photos). i\\'m 5\\' 8\", 32dd, i usually wear a 6, and the small is great. my only complaint is that the bottom of the skirt around the ankles is super tiny, and i feel like i have to take itty-bitty steps. it\\'s a bit off-putting not to be free to stride normally. i recommend the dress, but you may consider (like i am) having a professional add I am so bummed. these jeans are the perfect weight, totally distressed (and torn) in a way that looks like you\\'ve owned them for years, they flare out at the bottom of the legs just the right amount...but there is one huge - or i should write small - problem: your thighs have to be incredibly small to get these pulled all the way on. \\r\\n----------\\r\\ni am a 27 in level 99 and ag brand jeans, and a 28 in my other pairs of coh jeans and in mih jeans as well. i do not have an hourglass figure (my shou I decided to order this on a whim during the promotion on tops, why? because it looked decent and i like the other tops from the same brand. i am so glad i did, it is even better in person.\\r\\n\\r\\ncolor: nice ivory with subtle speckle in it. very neutral in color, but also on the warmer side. the fabric is a little sheer, you could definitely see my bright colored bra, but a nude one will do the trick.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe length was a little longer, and the sleeves were a bit long too (doesn\\'t come in peite0, bu So i haven\\'t actually tried this and i\\'m sorry for the misleading star rating. i just wanted to get someone\\'s attention on the length. the photos show the dress draping with almost a train even with the model in platform heels but in the video, the dress is about 2 inches off the floor. is it the model in the video that is extra tall? someone help me out. this looks gorgeous but since it\\'s an online exclusive, i won\\'t be able to try it on at the store. I fell in love with this dress the instant i saw it. but was disappointed when i received it. first was the color. i chose the green and it wasn\\'t what i thought. it was a very unnatural shade of artificial grass. when my husband saw it in the package he thought i had ordered a cheap grass hula skirt. the color was that bad. the fit was the next problem. this dress would have fit nicely if they had just added a side zip and made the top more fitted. the top was loose and that added to the flowy I thought this top was so cute but when i tried it on, it is so big on the bottom, it looks like a tent. i normally wear a l or xl and took it back to the store to try on a medium and that one fit better but the bottom was still too big. sad. Got this in the sky color. returned it because the top is way too sheer for me, if you know what i mean. i wanted a pretty gown i can wear without a robe in front of my kids. no can do. also, for the price, material just felt flimsy & cheap. it does run small ~ the medium was good on me and i\\'m 5\\'2\", 114#, 34b Love this tunic...and so do others! so many compliments already!! i\\'ve worn it with skinny jeans as well as flowy black pants. it needs a cami underneath since it\\'s sheer. i also like to wear it with my long retailer necklaces! Great cardigan that can be put over everything! cute with yoga pants, jeans, or something dressier. This is indeed a very flattering dress and looks great - unless you move in it. the fabric shows every little lump and bump on your body as you move and clings to tights (only a little but just enough to make it annoying). if you have any jiggle at all, i\\'d steer clear. would have definitely kept it if the fabric were different because the cut is amazing but alas. I really liked the fit and feel of these pants except the bottom of the pant leg was more bell shaped than i wanted (bought white pilcro culottes last year and they weren\\'t like this), but it wasn\\'t a deal breaker. when i got home, i tried to pair the chocolate pants with something to wear in the summer, but it wasn\\'t working for me. i think the color was just too dark and fall-feeling. they do run big, so i\\'d think about sizing down ... definitely worth giving them a try if you\\'re okay with the This top would be perfect if not for the large gap in the front where it wraps. the hook and loop just do not work to keep the top closed. love the pink color and the fit otherwise. i am almost always a medium but the small was perfect for me. for reference: 5\\'6\", 145 lbs, 34dd. I wasn\\'t sure about these when i first took them out, but they are so cute! the fabric is super soft and skims the body/is not clingy. i got the black & the red. the red is more of a magenta, but i\\'m okay with that. i think these will be great in the fall and early winter too, under cardigans & light jackets. another bonus, they do not show a ton of cleavage, like a lot of tops out there. the arm holes are also very close to perfect. i hate how big the armholes are on tops that basically require Like other reviewers, i\\'m glad i sized down. this is a cute tunic that is definitely great quality, lightweight chambray. i love that it has pockets, but they do puff a bit at my hips. You have to give this dress a try - yes, it runs small - i\\'m usually a 4 in retailer dresses. / 32dd 5\\'5\" 130lb - i couldn\\'t button the top button with my bra on but i could without it on - it fit perfect every where else. it is very flattering in every way. it\\'s 100% cotton, lightweight, and soft. the flare does not have too much fabric and is actually slimming unlike other fit and flare dresses. the sz 6 fit more comfortable and i could wear my bra which looked better and gave my breasts a lift Just like in picture! super cute and comfortable sweater! Got this in the blue and was so excited. while it looks cute, someone had clearly bought this, worn it, and returned it. it had human and dog hair all over it. not to mention some kind of red strings. it was pilling all over. so much for quality control!!! i don\\'t mind buying used things but at least clean it up and give me a discount! This jacket is cute and comfy! I love this dress, i love the style, i love the pattern, i love the feel of the fabric. there\\'s a slight puffiness to the shoulders that surprised and delighted me. however, i think it runs a little large, particularly because it\\'s not fitted at all - that tie around the waist is the only defining feature, and it\\'s a great one: this dress (and your figure) needs it. i am 135 pounds, 5\\'5\", and i normally wear a 6. perhaps i should\\'ve known to try a small, but i went with my usual size in dresses I purchased this blouse in my usual size xl. the wine color is very nice, sort of a rusty cranberry. i so badly wanted to love this blouse but i have to return it. there is so much fabric in the back that it makes me look like a giant cranberry. it is not flattering at all on my full figure. maybe if i was very slender, the massive volume of fabric wouldn\\'t matter but sadly it needs to go back. on a side note, this is a cotton blouse and i believe it is going to require ironing since i badly wri Wow, this sweater is, as other reviewers have said, perfect weight and the colors are vibrant and will work well with fall colors! i\\'m 5\\'11\" so i\\'m always hoping the length works and in this case it does! i am very happy with this! This dress had so much potential but the horizontal knit ruined it. i tried on size xxs in grey since my usual petite xxs size was not available. the fabric was a good weight and dress was well constructed. however, the wide horizontal knit made the dress bulge out at places especially in the lower body thus made me look wide and bulky. i wish they had used a cable knit pattern which will make the dress drape much more nicely and more flattering. Purchased today at the 30% off summer tag sale. 5\\'7 and bought the size 6 - fits perfectly. a lovely combination of feminine and boho. will wear with dark jeans a a white tank. fabulous light, pretty summer topper... I got these in gray. like other reviewers mentioned, the waist is a little higher (not 70s though) but the jean had great control so it \"holds\" everything in instead of creating a muffin top which many shorter waisted jeans do. contours to the leg. love it! This dress is a bit scratchy, but overall i liked the fabric well enough. on someone blond and fair, the peach color washes out a bit. the issue for me with the dress is that front is just too short for my height (i\\'m 5 9 1/2). it looked a bit obscene. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe small otherwise fit me great. i have broad shoulders, small chest and and slim. The print of this skirt is so fun. i love how it\\'s styled on the model, and i could see it being very versatile. i decided not to keep it because, mainly, it is pricey and i\\'m afraid it\\'ll get easily damaged. if i would wear it, i think i\\'d be worried about sitting on a dirty chair or spilling something on my lap and it being really visible-- and then having to upkeep it through dry cleaning. the fabric\\'s nice and good quality. but honestly, if the skirt were cheaper and the fabric were cotton a Love the top. love the color. love the back detail. as a larger chested woman, the shape was lost a bit. but i just couldn\\'t resist. Let me start off by saying that i really, really wanted this jumpsuit to work as it looked good on me and was tts (got a 6p). unfortunately, it didn\\'t work out due to the two buttons at the top which break way too easily. i had to return it and exchange for another jumpsuit but it did me no good as the second one did the very same thing so i didn\\'t even bother trying it on. the buttons broke through before i even got the chance as the material is far too thin and the back of the buttons just pop I loved this top when i saw it online, and ordered it right away. however, the fit is way off. i am always a size medium. always. but i was swimming in this and had to return it. even if it had fit, i wasn\\'t thrilled with it. i thought it would be something i could dress up, especially with the lace detail, but instead it looked really frumpy. i would recommend this top as long as you know to order a smaller size and are looking for something a little more casual. In person the colors are prettier and it\\'s more interesting than the front shot in the model. i tried on and bought my regular medium. got home and tried it on and realized it\\'s too big:( Wow, this sweater is, as other reviewers have said, perfect weight and the colors are vibrant and will work well with fall colors! i\\'m 5\\'11\" so i\\'m always hoping the length works and in this case it does! i am very happy with this! Bought this in my usual size small and it fits well. i wear it around the house constantly to stay warm this winter. it is so very warm and comfortable. very easy to wear. could be worn out, but i prefer it with lounge pants due to the comfort and warmth it provides. it is a nice neutral and can be worn with many other retailer casual clothes. highly recommend! How could this not be flattering to every figure? bunching of fabric is awesome at hiding imperfections (i know, i have become a master at hiding some of my residual baby weight for years now). this, paired with a darker color (and not black, yay!) makes for a perfect combination in a dress. i love that this is a deep purple, it is a dark color which is slimming, but in addition it has more appeal being colored. and it is so versatile! wear it along or with a cardigan/jacket on top. heels or boo I so wanted this skirt to work, love the design! but, it\\'s way, way too long... i am 5, 5, 116lb, and the small is 1 inch on the floor. i step on the skirt as i walk. I just received this today by mail, i am going to keep it as the reddish color is really pretty, it is very lightweight and will travel well for my summer vacations. however my first observation is the same as was noted in a previous review - not quite sure how to keep this dress in place - as soon as you move your arms around the dress goes out of place - and it slips back onto your shoulders . hopefully it will work out, will try a couple more times before i make a final decision i think. Fits true to size. good quality, style and length. I found this tee to run true to size with a comfortable relaxed fit. the neckline and elegant button gives this tee enough detail to dress it up if you wanted to take it in that direction. Much to my surprise when i tried on this sweater i found that it was cut in a bell shape and not at all fitted or straight like in the photo. when i pulled it out of the package i thought i\\'d ordered the wrong size because the shoulders looked so narrow. but when i tried it on the shoulders fit perfectly, with beautiful detail and high quality material, but the sweater belling out to a very wide shape. it is very wide at the hip and looks out of proportion. it doesn\\'t look anything like the phot I loved this t-shirt. i got the grey one in small. i\\'m a size 2 and 5\\'3. it is a relaxed fit. i love it because it is a bit different and the flowers add a nice flair. i didn\\'t want t plan t shirt but i also didn\\'t want anything too crazy. fits well and is soft too. Loved the sweater and the sale price was great, but i could not take the shedding! even after just trying it on the first time, my jeans and top had shedding all over them. this was 2 minutes, i could not imagine what i would look like if i wore it all day. had to return. I really wanted to love the shorts.  when i read that the shorts were lined, i expected them to be lined so that my underwear didn\\'t show.  even though the shorts are lined, you can see through the fabric completely.  this was absolutely disappointing since the shorts have a lovely exterior design; pockets; and, comfortable waistline.  i\\'m returning the shorts as well. This is a deliciously soft and cozy cashmere sweater. the cashmere is thick and knitted with a ribbed brioche stitch. the sweater is true to size, though a bit boxy, so i did size down for a slightly more fitted and flattering look. the sweater is a little on the short side, but i\\'m petite, so i thought the regular xxs was perfect. the stitch details are lovely and it it so soft i want to wear it every day. it did start to pill after one wear, but this is the nature of cashmere. i\\'m very pleased I ordered this top in a 14, my usual size, and it fits fine, but it is way too short-waisted! it looks nothing like what the model is wearing. her top comes low on her waist, almost to her crotch area. mine was just about 2 inches below my belly button! it was almost as if they accidentally cut off the lower half of the top at the factory! very strange. Tried this on at the store after falling in love with the color scheme and cut. tons of compliments from the dressing room ladies-this is a hot item in colorado apparently! was surprised that my regular size-small-was too tight in the shoulders, armpits, and upper arms, and i\\'m not big! (5\\'7,\" 140 lbs., 32d) ended up with with a medium. 100% cotton so i won\\'t be machine drying this cuz it looks prone to shrinkage. too casual to wear to work but it\\'ll be fun to run errands, etc. in this for at le I purchased these pants in blue, they fit great - only problem is that one leg is about 1/2 inch longer than the other. i got them on sale with a discount so i will keep them and take them to a tailor to fix. bummer. Although i love retailer, this product isn\\'t the quality or presentation i expect from them. the dress arrived stuffed into a small plastic bag and was a crumpled mess. the fabric wasn\\'t soft and fluid as i expected, but rather was stiff and a little scratchy. i purchased the ecru version, which was also slightly darker than the photo showed. i returned the dress and will keep looking. The sleeves were very tight in the upper arm area but the body was blousy, too blousy so to go up a size for the arms would mean it would be very oversized in the body. i like the fabric (nice and thick) but it did not work for me. This is a great shirt. the ruffles are strategically placed and hide any stomach flaws. i get that others are surprised by the arm slits but a couple of well placed stitches will make it very work appropriate or if you\\'re worried about arm waggle. the color borders on black/navy This is a really soft, nice, summery top. i love the criss-cross detail on the back, as well as the button down. it fits looser around the stomach, but not in a trash-baggy way. \\r\\n\\r\\nit mostly fits true to size; the only issue is that the top button doesn\\'t leave a whole lot of room if you have boobs at all. i wear a 34b -- pretty normal, not large -- and usually wear a small. i\\'ve found that the top button buttons fine, and looks good when i\\'m not moving, but it pulls a little when i move around Loved these when i tried them on they fit well and were so flattering. i am a size 0/2 and 5\\' tall and have a \\'bubble butt\\' and thicker thighs with a narrow waist i tried on a 24 they we a little tight on my bum and thighs but the waist was perfect, tried on a 25 and they were much more comfortable on my legs and worked on my waist as well. i thought all was good but after wearing them out for not even ten minutes they started slipping down constantly and loosed up around all areas especially my Love this little \"throw on and feel comfortable all day\" tee shirt This tunic is a great length - i\\'m 5\\'4\" and it hits me mid/lower thigh. it\\'s so soft and flowy which i love. i got a medium which is my normal size so i would say it runs a little big given that i\\'m almost 5 months pregnant with my second but it will still look and feel great post baby. arm holes are big but a cami can fix that. i got both colors available: the ivory and light red. I really like this shirt. the material was a little heavier cotton than i expected in looking at the picture which is good otherwise it could look like you slept in the shirt. it is something that is going to wrinkle when you wear it so if that is bothersome then pass on this shirt. it\\'s a bit longer which i also like because it will work by itself or under a jacket or sweater. I love this brand! they produced a number of incredibly cute blouses in 2006-2010 and i\\'ve missed their quirky designs. this shirt does not run small. i am usually a 6 and have a little extra room in the chest area, even though i\\'m a 34dd. the arms are the perfect length as well which is nice as i have long arms. the only reason i did not give it five stars is that i wish it was a bit more fitted through the stomach area. its very billowy. i may take it to the tailor... so cute though! on a side I wanted to love this coat so bad. the material is lovely and it\\'s beautiful on the hanger but being tall and skinny is a must to pull it off. if you have any hips forget it (my hips are 38\")- you end up looking incredibly bottom heavy. the jacket also ran funny across the shoulders....like the underarm was sewn low down the arm so arm movement was restricted, it was weird. but it buttoned nicely without any pulling so it wasn\\'t a size thing. i bought a size medium, at 5\\'5\" and 140 pounds. I wish this dress was more fitted.. the dress looks more fitted and more vibrant in the picture. i bought this dress in an xs, but i am not sure that going smaller would take care of the amount of material in this dress. it was shapeless and did not fall as nicely as it appears. i think someone with a fuller figure would look very nice in this dress. sad to say that it is going back. I was confused by this dress. the heavy fabric made me think of winter but the cut and print are springy. it\\'s also not lined and the material is not exactly soft. i put it back. cute, but missed the mark. This product has a terrible zipper that ultimately caused me to return the dress. it\\'s pretty bad when it won\\'t even zip up on the hanger. such a beautiful dress; it broke my heart! So nice to switch it up from all my black and gray sweats. these are luxuriously soft, and so so comfortable. they are light weight and beautiful. i am 5\\'5 , 125 and i am very happy with the size xs i purchased . was deciding between xs and s and i am happy i went with the xs. worth every penny. you won\\'t regret. also , finally - perfect length . This too is easy to wear, skins the body nicely & the color is very pretty. some of the retailer tops have issues for me because i find the necklines too low. not this one. the placket lays flat & doesn\\'t expose excessive cleavage. the details on the blouse are pretty & subtle. the top washed well in the delicate cute. just hang it to dry and it looks great! This suit is the most flattering suit i have owned in a while, as well as the most comfortable! though the suit is not lined, the light wetsuit material holds me in and is supportive, despite the open back and the slight looseness of it. if you do any water sports, i think this is a perfect suit. i did purchase some silicone covers for myself, however, to avoid looking like a farrah fawcett throwback. I bought the bronze color which was nice but the cut just hung like a dust rag, no fit , no drape\\nvery unfinished looking. though i bought it on sale on sale, it is not worth keeping. over all it was not a worthwhile blouse to keep. This top was a big disappointment. i ordered two of the grey motif with the print of the forest animals in size 16. neither of them fit well, but one was cut much smaller than the other. i\\'ve had this problem with all of the numerically-sized buttondown style of maeve tops. i don\\'t understand why in size 14 & 16, this keeps happening. that\\'s why i purchase two of each. usually one fits and the other doesn\\'t. this time, unfortunately, neither worked. they both were too tight in the arms/shoulders I started buying maeve dresses about five years ago and love every last one that i own! this one is no exception. i bought it in black last week (size s) for my birthday treat, and it was so wonderfully light during the week of 99 f heat in the district. it\\'s feminine and delicate in appearance, yet the material is of good quality and super comfortable. it\\'s awesome, just a perfect summer and probably fall dress. I don\\'t have a large head but i could barely squeeze this blouse over mine. i also ordered the xs even though i\\'m usually a small and it was still blousier than i would have liked. already returned it. on the plus side, it\\'s gorgeous. It is such a cute design and very soft and comfortable, but the picture for this product is very deceiving! it looks like the sweater is fairly long in the pictured product page, but it is considerably short. i am nearly six foot tall, but thought by this picture it would be lengthy, not at all!\\nit is a beautiful sweater, might work better for a shorter stature. Well, the model looks great and i really like interesting unusual designs as it can be really unique for very long time. i tried and when i opened package it was funny looking tent with several beautiful buttons. fits like tent, long, huge, make me look like i am on military trials and i supposed to be some sort of target. This shirt is beautiful, however i thought that it was made of a softer, lighter material. it is, instead, made of a thick, heavy material that was unflattering for my shape. ( short torso ann\\'s large bust) it made me look boxy and chunky in the middle. sadly, i\\'ll be returning it. I have to agree with the first reviewer! i really loved the color of this dress and could almost have overlooked the lack of a lining, but when i felt the fabric expecting a nice lush silk, instead getting what felt like a polyster instead i couldn\\'t justify it for the price. i really liked the fact that a maxi came in petite sizes as well, but just couldn\\'t get over the poor quality for that price so back it goes! \\r\\n\\r\\ni hope the team members or buyers at retailer are reading these reviews Just bought this in navy and love the easy versatility of it! the other colors in the print (including some black) can be worn as is, with a cardi, denim jacket, leggings/tights and boots, etc. i found the fit to be somewhat loose in my usual size 4, particularly in the chest (i\\'m 34a), and length was long enough to not need leggings in spring/summer (at 5\\'7\"). the neckline is cut somewhat low, but retains modesty in my opinion because of how narrow of a v it is (don\\'t feel need for cami). very I never write reviews I finally ordered a pair of these jeans after seeing so many rave reviews, and when they went on sale. i\\'m leaving this review for women who share my body type.\\r\\n\\r\\ni\\'m slim with longer legs, and don\\'t really have curves. i typically don\\'t purchase jeans with an inseam shorter than 30\\'\\'. for reference, i really love the fit of paige and m.i.h. jeans.\\r\\n\\r\\nthese jeans have an inseam of 31\\'\\', which i thought would be fine. but for me, the cut wasn\\'t flattering at all. i typically look for jeans that I was really disappointed when i tried this top on. the design and cut of the neckline is very bulky and just off. the cut of the top overall was just off. Dress looks awesome when your arms are down like the model. but don\\'t you dare lift your arms. i\\'m kinda tall and the dress barely covers my bum when arms are raised. keeping the dress but will have to keep my arms down ;) maybe? I wasn\\'t going to purchase this dress because it was given 1 star. however, i ordered it and i was so glad i did!!! i\\'m 5\\'1, 105lbs this dress fit me perfectly, it really compliment my petite body. i get so much compliments! it is not easy to order anything for a petite frame but this dress really show off my body without showing too much. I know rompers typically aren&amp;#39;t the easiest and while i loved this fabric this was a pain to put on no zipper, etc. and the buttons are tiny and since the fabric doesnt stretch it is difficult to even try on. the length of the shorts was great and the fit was just ok all in all i don&amp;#39;t think it is worth the price. I had loved this on-line when i saw the pretty floral pattern. however, in person, it is such a disappointment. the quality of the fabric and the fit are just very poor. My new favorite top to throw on Thought this would be great for a laid-back wedding in new mexico, but didn\\'t fit. i am a 12-14 and the 14 barely fit my chest and arms. not flattering. material did not seem very breakthable. had to return. better luck next time. Purchased this item on sale-received it and it had two huge holes on the side.not possible to repair. very disappointed in lack of quality control. :( I like the retro look but these seem to run large to me.  i get they are ruched on the sides.  yet, the bottom has a saggy look.  i got the large but i feel like i should have gotten the medium to fill out the bottom. i already took the strip out and washed so i\\'m keeping them.  very cute with a bikini top.  maybe i just need a bigger butt. I love this top!!! i usually wear a medium but all that was left were larges, so i figured i\\'d take a chance. it is gorgeous, and not too big! the quality is fabulous, and the color is very soft and complimentary. i am so glad i ordered this. can\\'t wait to wear it!!! I purchased the blue s (140lbs, 5\\'8\", 34b) and this was very large and boxy on me. not altogether unflattering but not so flattering that it justifies the price. the blue color is very pretty in person--darker and slightly marled. however, although this sweater is certainly cashmere (and very soft because of it), it is very thin--to the point that i consider this a \"top\" rather than a \"sweater.\" the silk panel in back is pretty but, again, thin and unlined. i think that, even on sale, this is ov Great soft basic. low scoop neck makes this tank flirty while the thicker strap keeps it modest. i absolutely love this top, easily dress up and down! When i tried it on it looked like a stiff bathrobe. straight, too boxy. Liked the netting around the collar but the whole blouse was very baggy. order size down. If you think you can pull this off by all means try it. the fabric is excellent quality--thick yet soft, and the floral print is lovely (unlike a lot of the prints this season). i am not exactly short (5\\'6\") and not wide (34-26-36), but this made me look like a houseboat. too bad, as it is such an interesting cut. i ordered down since i can sometimes wear an xs, but the bottom was still voluminous. It runs a little large, i got a small and it was still a little large in the shoulders (but maybe that is just my body type). otherwise i love this dress! This dress pattern and material are great - it\\'s just way too big. i even tried an xs and it looked like a huge sack on me. too bad, it had some real potential. Perfect high rise jeans - just a little bit of stretch for comfort. the high waist doesn\\'t roll down and no knicker cleavage when bending over. perfect to go with crop tops I recently bought this dress in an retailer store, to attend an art museum event,. the open back created an awkward bra exposure problem, which i solved by buying a gabardia camisole by lacausa (the same brand and print as the dress.) the dress is described as casual, but it can be dressed up with gold shoes or sandals. \\r\\nthe retailer saleswoman brought me the dara vegan leather jacket in plum, by hei hei to complete the outfit. the contrast between the airy dress and the vegan leather was chic and Material is so thin this shirt ripped in three places after wearing only once.\\r\\n\\r\\ngot a size larger than i needed as i have a larger chest and even though it\\'s a bit lose the thread has ripped material on my chest and in the armpits. I really wanted to love this sweater however it fell much shorter on my 5\\'10\" frame than it falls on the model, between my belly button and hip, and the sleeves ended just below my elbow and were much more voluminous than they appear in the product shot. i do have long monkey arms though, so on someone more petite it would probably fit more like the model shot.\\r\\nthe quality of the knit seems nice, however the zipper used is very slim and light weight and got stuck twice just while i was trying i This a great skirt for someone with a straight or boyish figure. this skirt does not accommodate a curvy figure - small waist, feminine hips. This sweater was in-store in a more neutral color palette and was so pretty. when i tried it on i noticed a few things: the versatility and quality are definitely there - this is a nice piece even at full-price. the downside is that it runs very large. i\\'m typically a 14/16 and a size xl in most retailer items, and even the large was a bit roomy. the other thing was that the sleeves of this sweater are pretty long (and i have long arms). due to the bell cut of the sleeve you couldn\\'t even really c I loved the design online but the sweater is bulky and boxy. i had chosen the cream with blue and now looking back at the other pictures of the beige/cream it represents it better. it made me look very wide. loved it online but it wasn\\'t for me, returned it. I ordered this in the neutral motif and the colors and design are more beautiful in person. unfortunately, there were no \"petites\" available when i ordered so i will have to have the length and slit tailored. I tried this on today because when i touched it, it was irresistibly soft. i like the orange, it was a loud orange-and i almost would have preferred some sort of design to it. i did not purchase this because at the end of the day it did not suit my style-it was very plain. i think you could dress it up with the addition of a belt or the right necklace, but i am not usually a fan of buying pieces that do not stand on their own and require an accessory. that said, it was very comfortable and soft This is a really cute shirt. i love the design, color and everything about this shirt but the size. i am 5\\'1 and 105 lbs, i can usually wear an xs or xsp. the xs was huge and they were sold out of smaller sizes or i would have ordered one. this unfortunately had to go back. Pros: material is amazing, super soft and quality thickness (but not like uber this, just enough, it will last). also seems like it won\\'t wrinkle much which would make it a great dress to throw in a bag for a trip. fits well in the shoulders, chest and the length is good.\\r\\n\\r\\ncons: the \"waist\" line is really tight and really really high. i\\'m 5\\'8\", 150lbs and my usual medium is pretty tight. of course it hits me on the rib cage too, which is so weird. it\\'s way higher than it should be.\\r\\n\\r\\ni\\'ll pro I love holding horses and i am always be size 2 in their clothes (32dd, 5\\'3\", curvy). i ran into my local retailer to grab a shirt they had on hold and had to try this on because it\\'s so cute. i couldn\\'t get the 2 zipped and it seemed to be rather narrow in the torso. such a bummer! I ordered these in both colors. the red is much deeper in person, more like a burgundy than pictured here. these tees are very slouchy. if you wanted a more fitted look, size down. these are very soft and very comfy and will pair well with ponte leggings and skinny jeans. the overall quality seems very good, although they are thinner than i thought they would be (they seemed like they would be thick and stiff to me based on the photos).\\n----------\\noverall these are very nice. but there is one is I like the pointelle feature in the front. i end up wearing a lot of black, but this at least gives me the option to do a bit of color underneath if i so chose. i\\'ve worn this with white, black and blue jeans w/ boots. looks great. i\\'m 5\\'3\" and 125 lbs. i got a medium, but i could have possibly gone with a small. my only complaint is that it might be a tad bit too long. since i\\'m on the shorter size, i can\\'t imagine it would be too much of an issue for others. This sweater did not flatter a sz 12 with 36d chest. it\\'s very well made but not for the curvy girl. this is my very first review and felt compelled to share my thoughts since i heavily rely on others\\' reviews before i purchase. Absolutely love these pants! i have had these pilcos for about two months now and it has been a staple in my fall wardrobe. i have worn them at least once a week. the only downfall is the button has already fallen off and the seam in the knee has recently torn apart. given the leather, i\\'m not sure if they can be fixed. these are fabulous, but the quality is just not there. very disappointing. I love everything about this except the length. i am short and usually order a petite and even this is really cropped on me. the quality is good, thick and substantial, color is great but very cropped and sleeves are long on me as well. just weird proportions so sadly, going back. This shirt is beautiful, however i thought that it was made of a softer, lighter material. it is, instead, made of a thick, heavy material that was unflattering for my shape. ( short torso ann\\'s large bust) it made me look boxy and chunky in the middle. sadly, i\\'ll be returning it. I have been wanting this skirt since it came out, and was overjoyed when it went on sale. i got my typical 00 size (24-26 waist, xsmall-xxsmall shirts/dresses), but when i tried it on i was a bit confused. the waist is a little roomy,so there\\'s no way i could wear a 0, but the skirt hugs my butt. and i\\'m talking in that weird \"hug the butt but flares out awkwardly below way\". now i don\\'t consider myself particularly gifted in the back end department, but this skirt sure says the opposite! i can\\' This top is beautiful in the model shot, but average in person. it ran really small, i usually take a medium in retailer tops and ordered this in a medium. it barely fit over my chest, and was pretty short (i am 5\\'7\"). also, the material is very thin, not so much that you can see your undergarment, but if you get cold everyone will know it. also, for the price, i expected a sturdier fabric. i would recommend holding out for sale, if you are interested in this top. I purchased this top on sale and was really excited about the style. it fit great the first time i wore it. i washed it once, according to the care instructions. after washing it in cold water and allowing it to air dry, it was basically ruined. it shrunk up in length widened out about two inches. i\\'m pretty bummed about it because it was cute. I second that above review who states \"worst blouse i\\'ve ever ordered\" This product has a terrible zipper that ultimately caused me to return the dress. it\\'s pretty bad when it won\\'t even zip up on the hanger. such a beautiful dress; it broke my heart! This is a beautiful dress with gorgeous details but it is not as long as it appears in the photo. i am 5\\'9\"and ordered an xl. the dress comes just below my knees. I look like a stuffed sausage in these pants and i even went up a size. for some reason, this fabric isn\\'t working for me. i think it\\'s the sheed combined with the stretch (or lack there of) of the fabric. i\\'ll have to pass. This cardigan is very cute. but after 1 wash and no dryer the back has a bunch of pulled threads! very bummed with the quality. I have been looking at rompers for a while but being that i\\'m 40, a lot of stores seem to carry rompers that are super short. i think these are the perfect length for summer (and for me!). it\\'s cute! i am 5\\'5\" and 110 pounds and i ordered the xs. i docked one start because the top part seems to have a bit of excess fabric. if i pull the waist up, the top 1/2 balloons out a little awkwardly. but if i pull the shorts down so that the drawstring is resting lower than my natural waist, it looks okay The beadwork is gorgeous, but the sleeves are so puffy, it looks as though you\\'re wearing shoulder pads. the fabric of the shirt isn\\'t that fabulous either. This dress is very flattering. great unique dress. This dress is amazing! love the fit, quality and design. so unique and is perfect for dressing up or down. wore it to a wedding and plan on wearing it to work. also, i\\'m a tall girl (5\\' 11\") and this dress was such a good length for me. no one likes a dress that\\'s too short. i ordered a size 8 and it fit perfectly around the waist and chest. Cute layered cami. great colors for summer or fall. very light fabric, tends to get a bit staticy. shorter in the back than expected but a good versatile top This shirt is not what i expected. i ordered the \"green\" motif, which is not green at all but black. in the product photos the drawings appear to have a white outlining but its brown. the shirt is made of a good quality cotton and fits great. i ordered the medium. which gave me a lot of extra room to where i could have sized down to a small. for reference i am a 36b and usually wear a medium in most retailer tops. i don\\'t plan on keeping this because i was really hoping for a white background to t Lovely dress. i did send it back only because the length was below my knee and i prefer slightly above the knee. I was very excited to get this dress in the mail. i wasn\\'t sure about the sizing because there weren\\'t any reviews written yet. i got the m which fit across my chest area and fit fine, but there was just so much fabric below the bust. i love that it\\'s different, but i think you\\'d have to be a stick figure for this shape to work for you. it does not flatter your body at all. Would recommend, but with the caveat that i had to return due to the pants being way too big all over, even the length was more than i expected from the photos online. i am 5\\'5\" 120lbs narrow hips, usually a 25 in pants (including other level 99 pants i own). i ordered a 25 and i could have pulled them off completely buttoned, plus they went nearly to my ankles. anyhow, the material is really nice, soft and comfy, color was good (i ordered the dark), and i could imagine they would be super cute I love the design of this top, however, it\\'s quality is lackluster. the shirt is pretty short and would be more flattering (at least on me) if it had a few more inches. also it\\'s pretty sheer, so figuring out under garments is a dilemma. i will still wear it because i love it. looks great with a denim vest over it! I was a little worried this top wouldn\\'t look quite as nice as it does online due to the price, but it is super cute in person too. tank underneath is attached but does not get in the way. great top! cannot wait to wear it! Adorable top, but i have to agree with what two other reviewers said... that is is boxy and unflattering. i have a similar patterned top, also by maeve, but the sizing on that runs small, medium, large. the s petite that i have doesn\\'t fit quite the same as the 4 petite in this blouse. this is definitely more \"square\" in the torso, and the ruffles do stick out more - very flouncy. it just made me look frumpy instead of the sexy date night look i was going for. i am 5\\' and 120 lbs. also, i didn\\'t This is a really soft, nice, summery top. i love the criss-cross detail on the back, as well as the button down. it fits looser around the stomach, but not in a trash-baggy way. \\r\\n\\r\\nit mostly fits true to size; the only issue is that the top button doesn\\'t leave a whole lot of room if you have boobs at all. i wear a 34b -- pretty normal, not large -- and usually wear a small. i\\'ve found that the top button buttons fine, and looks good when i\\'m not moving, but it pulls a little when i move around This may be the ugliest dress with the worst fit i have ever tried. the blue stripes are brighter than they appear in the photo, absolutely garish. the top is baggy with awful beads on the back ties, it just looks cheap. the skirt is an antebellum nightmare.  \\r\\ni did not even want to try it on, it\\'s that bad. i considered adding a photo, but was too horrified.\\r\\nfor reference, i\\'m 5\\'10\", approximately the height/ size of the model, but it was shorter than the photo depictes. i wanted to like it, This one will be going back. the color is really blah and the fabric wasn\\'t a texture i was expecting--it is kind of thick and ribbed and i suspect it would stretch out over the course of the day. overall, the cut and style is cute, but i just felt like i was wearing a hospital gown with the combination of the fabric and the style. this may have been cute in a more vibrant color and lighter weight fabric. This dress didn\\'t work for me for several reasons, but i knew i wouldn\\'t keep it as soon as i saw the ribbing on the neck and arms, which makes an otherwise flexibly styled dress (dress up/dress down) into super casual only (plus it looks cheap). it is also not for the long waisted or tall.\\r\\n\\r\\non the plus side, the fabric feels great, and it hangs well. I love the design of this blouse and the pattern, but the colors are a bit darker than in the photo. the quality is pretty poor. i feel like its a snag away from being ruined and thrown away and for this price it is just not worth the purchase. sending it back :( \\r\\nit comes with a tank top; just to let others know. As a tall girl, i was thrilled to see that these pants come in longs! they are amazing for dressing up (or sassing up) and outfit. i anxiously anticipated their arrival and wore them the very first night i bought them. however, as someone previously mentioned the quality is poor. after wearing them to they symphony, the knee tore while i was sitting in my seat! i really don\\'t see a way to avoid this from happening since i had not moved. i\\'m sooo upset because i absolutely loved these pants! Delaine blazer so many little details with a slight bit of ruggedness. loved the unmatched buttons, checkered back and fraying that gave this piece personality making it appear less stuffy. easyily dress it up or down, that being said it seems to run true to size except the arms and shoulders were very tight. i would consider going up a size if more of an athletic build. ordered a 4 but i think a 6 would have been perfect! I really was uncertain when ordering these because linen can be difficult. these are actually very flowy and soft. i do think they run a bit large. the petite sizes sold out so i ordered a regular 27. it stretched out a bit too much by the end of the day. if that\\'s the case, you need to be careful because the hook and tiny belt are going to struggle to keep up. you should consider ordering down if you are in between sizes. otherwise, the rose color is beautiful, accurate to the website, and work I love this dress. it\\'s beautiful and flattering. not to mention that it is also comfortable with a bit of stretch. i couldn\\'t see it in the picture, but the black parts on the shoulders in front and on the back is sheer, so you have to be careful with underwear choice. i have an apple shape and yet this was flattering and the perfect length. i am short and apple-shaped and it was a great choice. I also expected this sweater to have more bulk to it per the images. it is very thin as others have said. the design is awkward with the sleeve placement and that makes it more flowy vs. structured. it is more similar to a cape or shawl design. if you;\\'re looking for a warm cozy blanket sweater design, this is not it. i will keep it though as a layering piece and because of the sale price and classic color design. I bought this shirt in a l, since i didn\\'t want it to be too fitted and was concerned a m would be. it is so boxy! it\\'s like a completely different shirt. i have no idea how it looks good on anyone, unless it is simply widened the larger the size. maybe a m wouldn\\'t be as wide and therefore as boxy, but this shirt is just a bad mess. returning. I\\'ve been eyeing this dress for months, so when it went on sale i finally purchased it. now i see why it\\'s on sale.\\nthe dress runs extremely large and has no shape.... looks like a potatoe sack and i feel like moo...moo in it!\\nthis will be going back to the store!!!! I have been looking for a button-down denim skirt that would be short enough for me, and was glad to see that this one came in a petite. i ordered it in a 2p and a 4p with plans to return the one that didn\\'t fit. 99% of the time, one of these sizes will fit me. in this case, however, even the 2p was slightly too big. i\\'m going to exchange for a 0p. for anyone who normally wears a 0, you might want to pass on this, as it will probably be too big.\\r\\n\\r\\non the plus side, it\\'s quite lightweight and so Perfect except a little snug around the hips. very forgiving silhouette. I\\'m wearing this shirt right now. i\\'m usually a large in tops. i bought a medium and i\\'m kinda wishing i got a small instead. it\\'s very swingy. its super cute but size down at least one size maybe two I like this jacket, very neutral in color, classic cut and vintage like old retailer. unfortunately, i ordered xs p and not xxs p... and i found it wasn\\'t right on me, a little loose, so not as flattering. i understand that jackets are meant to be worn over things, but i didn\\'t love the look. some may find the material itchy, fine for me, but i am not as sensitive as others (can do small amounts of wool). i am 115 lbs, 30 dd and 26.5 in waist, for reference with sizing,. I purchased this top (i thought of it as a sweater) to wear for a chilly holiday in mn. it\\'s super flattering and i think it would be on anyone! my 28 year old daughter saw it on me and claimed at a christmas present so i just ordered another. we have very different body types but the neckline made us both look very elegant and it is super comfortable. i haven\\'t seen how it cleans, yet. we both got the lighter colored one...love! Likes: colors, the design of the flower is very pretty, the color-blocking is a nice touch and in this season, but, it is pretty short.\\n\\ni bought thh petite right off the bat as i assumed i would need that, but i really dind\\'t. it ended up beign too short.\\n\\n#/4 sleeves always flattering, but hte cut is meant to be comfy, i think it would have looked better on me if it was a little more hourglass hsaped (if that makes sense#.\\n\\ni am usually xs, and that was fine, so buy your usual size ok #one siz I really wanted this dress to be perfect, but the skirt portion flares out in a way that was not flattering. the other reviewer is about 8 inches taller than me, perhaps it works better on a taller frame. I love this shirt for a throw on and go.  hangs nicely and fits great.  colors are more vibrant in person.  i love mauve, i think they do a great job with their designs! These could barely fit over my calf and did not even broach my knee. i have big calves but i am otherwise i slim and normal sized woman. these are way too tight and narrow to enjoy or to get much use out of. The armholes on this dress are totally bizarre. i can\\'t believe no one else has commented on them yet. i am a size s on top and m on the bottom so i usually try on both in dresses. i tend to be a small/ size 6 in retailer. the armholes are so long that the dress doesn\\'t lay right on top. i showed it to on of the clerks in the store and she agreed with me. we looked at all the others and they were the same. going up a size made it way worse. this dress might work for someone with really broad shoul Wish i would have read the reviews before i purchased and wore two of these. washed as directed and same outcome as everyone else. basically unwearable unless i maybe use it for a nightshirt. the shrinkage lengthwise was ridiculous. glad i didn\\'t buy every color like i had planned to do! Love the natural fabric blend and the natural style, also the unique color of the taupe. i am a size 4 to 6, and the small fit great. if you prefer a more fitted look, could probably size down. Very sheer inexpensive material. even on sale i\\'m returning it Love this top, dramatic in a casual way.\\r\\ni ordered the teal and love love love it....with skinny jeans or leggings the style is perfect !\\r\\ni am over 50, so the teal is gorgeous and i think very age appropriate.\\r\\ni ordered the blue also, a very pretty shade of blue.........but felt in this style, the bright/light colors would be more appropriate for someone younger.\\r\\nit\\'s a stunning top...........and fits very true to size..........the drama of the ruffle is what sets it apart..\\r\\nhoping they do I love this top! the sizing was great, and i have already worn it so many times, and received so many compliments! it is great to dress up or down! such a great purchase! I just returned this top. i agree with the previous reviewer. the neckline is way too deep, i ordered small and i looked ridiculous in it. also the ruffles didn\\'t look so great on me either. The dress looks great both in winter and summer, either paired with tights and a light jacket or on its own. it runs true to size--was able to buy it online. the fabric is great for all day wear--doesn\\'t wrinkle too much.\\n\\nthe only con is that the darts over the breasts are a little pointy for my taste, but i still love the dress. I brought this shirt for a vacation, it fitted well and was flattering. totally a comfortable wear, however, after 1 wash on delicate & hang dry small holes appeared near the bottom. i am hoping i can return it. not worth the money. I purchased this top in the black and tan color, loved the fit, style and fabric. however, it is a loose weave and after just one wearing a hole opened up on the front, which could not be repaired. it was covered by the cowl neck collar but as the day wore on the hole got bagger and it can no longer be hidden. i was very disappointed in the quality of this top- i purchased it at full price and was only able to wear it once. i just didn\\'t have the time to return it to the store. I\\'m an hourglass shape and on me this dress didn\\'t give me any shape at all. and i felt the bell sleeves were a little much. the lining though is really soft and excellent for colder weather. and the print is very pretty, just as pictured. This may be the ugliest dress with the worst fit i have ever tried. the blue stripes are brighter than they appear in the photo, absolutely garish. the top is baggy with awful beads on the back ties, it just looks cheap. the skirt is an antebellum nightmare.  \\r\\ni did not even want to try it on, it\\'s that bad. i considered adding a photo, but was too horrified.\\r\\nfor reference, i\\'m 5\\'10\", approximately the height/ size of the model, but it was shorter than the photo depictes. i wanted to like it, This is a very pretty jacket. light weight and perfect for spring/fall. i had ordered it online as it was not in my retailer store. i did end up returning it though. it does run large, i am usually a l/xl and based on previous reviews i did size down and get the l. the pockets for me were a little big an pushed out having an unflattering look! i was sad to have to send this one back! i was hoping to love it! someone smaller might love it!! The shirt does have a weird yellow tinge as other reviewers have described. i could get over that if the shirt was a flattering fit which it was not. not worth the money so i returned it. Hi, i would have to agree with all of the reviewers.i unfortunately had to find out for myself. mistake. it\\'s huge. i love the quality and design but even if you sized down two sizes it wouldn\\'t help. I love this dress so much that i purchased it in both grey and wine. i find the cut very flattering and slimming, and love the pockets. it works great for northern california winters, with tights, boots, boiled wool sweatercoat over it while outdoors, and on its own indoors. i wish there was a long-sleeved version. i feel exceptionally cute and cozy while wearing it. good job, sparrow! btw, i bought the other currently offered sparrow wool dress (the mock-neck dress), and this one is just an inc I bought these cords in navy. the color is beautiful and the fit is great. it is a very slimming fit. i am usually between a 27 and 28, i ordered the 28 and they fit perfectly! I truly cannot understand the great reviews on this dress!  i purchased in both a sp and a mp.  i am 5\\'2\" 120#.  the mp fit perfectly.  i definitely wouldn\\'t keep it though because it looks like someone sewed a bunch of old sweatshirts together.  it\\'s not super soft, coarse on the inside, and feels old.  the back is longer than the front, it just looks like something my daughter would make in sewing class out of scraps.  even with leggings and great boots, it looks worn. I ordered this in my usual size 0 and couldn\\'t finish zipping up the top, but also couldn\\'t fill in the boobs. i am 5\\'7, 116 lbs, 32a. it is very cute, but the top was pretty stiff and unless it draped on you correctly, could probably be bothersome. i was disappointed in the quality of the skirt- no lining, simple cotton/polyester. i will probably return, try the size up, but was disappointed compared to how excited i was for it. i did like that it had pockets, and would be a fun dress to wear f Absolutely love everything about this dress. unlike many other dresses i\\'ve ordered from retailer it fits me in the chest (34c). it\\'s very flattering. love the lace up front and the fabric is like a soft lined linen. can\\'t wait to wear it. i got the s regular. if i was any bigger in the chest or through the ribs tho it would be too small. i almost ordered the medium and was certain i would end up needing a bigger size but the small turned out just right. like it was made for me This cute dress highlights some trouble spots and emphasizes good parts too, so i\\'m happy but not ecstatic.  for myself, the sleeves are tight and  so is the fit across the back and shoulders.  sizing up makes the voluminous skirt overwhelming.  the skirt is already a lot to handle in my regular size.  the good part is the pattern, swingy silhouette and it covers my tummy.  i have thick arms, wide bust, round back and meaty shoulders.  140# 5\\'3\" 36d and purchased size 10. Despite other reviewers comments on size - i really wanted this one to work so i ordered it. i\\'m typically a size xs and d chest and instead i ordered a small. the body of the sit for well but the cups of the suit i\\'d said for more for a b. (if i lifted my arms i would literally come out of it) This dress has pretty colors. the top fit well but the bottom looked like an upside down umbrella. it has enough material to make 2 skirts and the big pockets on the sides make the skirt stick out sideways. the photo of model is from side, not the front. very unflattering on me. If this product was in petite, i would get the petite. the regular is a little long on me but a tailor can do a simple fix on that. \\r\\n\\r\\nfits nicely! i\\'m 5\\'4, 130lb and pregnant so i bough t medium to grow into. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe tie can be front or back so provides for some nice flexibility on form fitting. Loved it online for its modern cut and print. however, when i received the item i was disappointed. i ordered my usual size 4 and i was swimming in it. i like oversized things and understand that this dress is made that way; however, this was not flattering. i would say i would have needed to size down to a 0 and perhaps it would work but i didn\\'t want to take another chance. the material seemed almost crepey, which i wasn\\'t neccissarily expecting either. bummer that it didn\\'t work out. This is a fantastic sweater--really soft, great details. but it\\'s huge. i\\'m generally between an xs and a s at retailer, and most always an xs with pure + good. but this time even the xs is huge! i wish they offered this one in an xxs. i love it so much that i may keep it anyway? it\\'s really comfortable and i love the style. looks decent with my arms down (like the model\\'s pose), but when my arms are lifted out to either side, it really looks huge. i\\'ll have to think on this one. Retailer consistently provides unique, sophisticated and quality made clothing. with the exception of an occasional purchase at their sister companies, i shop with them exclusively. i suppose that i can\\'t expect 100% perfection from retailer-but 99% of the time-that\\'s what i get. this is that 1%...this sweater is truly awful! i cannot (or find it very difficult at least) begin to describe what this sweater is like but it is so unlike retailer that, had it not been for the distinct pattern on the front I love all whimsical prints and shirtdresses and wanted so badly for this to work!  i\\'m an athletic person with more of a pear shape so a-lines really work for me.  i got my usual size 2 in this dress, and while i felt like the waist was true to size, the top gapped so badly (i\\'m a 32b) that i had to return the dress.  a tailor probably could have done something to it, but i decided i did not want to mess with the extra expense.  too bad, because the fabric is a lovely weight, the length was per Holy cow does this run small-like really small. i ordered the normal size i would wear and couldn\\'t even get it passed my legs-until i supplied the most amount of effort i could (against my better judgment) and managed to get it on-but it was definitely too small. i would classify myself as petite and my normal size was way too short on my torso. it, of course, was a mistake to force it on because it was just as hard to get it off.\\n\\nthat said, i love the suit and am going to try in one and 2 siz Based on other customer reviews, i ordered these trousers expecting a lightweight cropped pant that would be appropriate for spring and especially summer. however, the fabric is much heavier than what i\\'d usually wear in the summer . the cut of the trousers were superb though - i like a low-rise or hipster cut which these are.\\n\\nthey are fitted and not oversized like many of the other retailer items i buy, so if you are an xs these will be xs (or runs small for retailer clothing) if you like your clo I love sweaters like this. it\\'s perfect over a tank top for a casual every day look. it\\'s soft, comfy, and i love the length. one more thing i like is that while it looks great just open, there is a snap to fasten it if you want to. This top is quite boxy and i was very disappointed with the color, it looked as if i\\'d washed it in filthy water. it\\'s a very dingy white, needless to say it went back. I loved the color and the neckline was flattering. however, it would have fit me better in a petite size bc i am 5\\'3\" and a 32f. it fits slim so to fit in my bust it was too long. also didn\\'t think the fabric was good quality for this price. I love the length of this and that i can wear it with skinny jeans or leggings, but it does seem to run a little small and it is not as long as on the model. i do think it is a cute addition to my wardrobe though. This product is just what i wanted. it was a great color and nice quality for the price. it is tighter than the model, but i am curvy and that\\'s usually the case. looks cute with a patterned pant and jewelry! Looks beautiful online but has too much material and the zipper catches on the lace. also runs very large, i am normally a small but would need and xs in this dress I put a lot of hopes on this pullover. i needed something for the spring, and it seemed perfect. plus, the sale price is very attractive compared to the regular retailer prices. but... i am not exactly disappointed, but i\\'d say surprised. \\r\\n\\r\\ni would still consider this sweater good for spring. it\\'s thin enough to be tucked into a skirt or pants if you like. the pullover is very stretchy - frankly, i would prefer it to be less stretchy, but that might be a plus for someone more busty. the quality I truly cannot understand the great reviews on this dress!  i purchased in both a sp and a mp.  i am 5\\'2\" 120#.  the mp fit perfectly.  i definitely wouldn\\'t keep it though because it looks like someone sewed a bunch of old sweatshirts together.  it\\'s not super soft, coarse on the inside, and feels old.  the back is longer than the front, it just looks like something my daughter would make in sewing class out of scraps.  even with leggings and great boots, it looks worn. Not being into bright neon colors, i love this top! the fit is true to size and helps to hide my tummy. it\\'s super cute and very flattering. I have purchased a lot from retailer but lately, some of the items have been disappointing in quality.verses cost, this being one. the picture is nice but the actual blouse is nothing like this. the size was not accurate so buy a size bigger because of the sleeves. After reading all the reviews i figured at 40% off i could at least try it. i\\'m 5\\' 3\" and typically wear a m or size 10. i ordered the m, but as other reviews stated the arms were tight. since i\\'m expecting it to shrink, and want it to cover my booty, i ordered 2 colors in the l. it\\'s exactly the oversized, slouchy look i wanted, without the neckline being too low, but will still be ok if it shrinks. i\\'ll have these dry cleaned to minimize shrinkage. it\\'s a wardrobe staple that looks great with I ordered:\\r\\nxsp\\r\\nxxs\\r\\nxxsp\\r\\n\\r\\nxxsp was the better fit, some people loved it some didn\\'t like as much (thought it was baggy and are not used to seeing me in baggy clothing. but that being said, ti was comfortable, the cutouts fell right on spot on my shoulders, and it is a nice casual embellished look half tucked in some boyfriend jeans. i reordered mine as it had something stuck on it and it bothered me (like sticky white) i will re-evaluate when i get the new order only because there are sooo m I wanted to love this dress! the material is beautiful! but sadly i agree with other reviewer. the model definitely has this pinned back! i am on the small side (5\\'5\", 120 lbs, straight figure, very tiny \"girls\") and this dress looked awful. totally swallowed what little shape i have and the swing did make me look prego in front and back. the fabric is stiff so i think that adds to the sticking out oddly. as far as sizing the arm jokes fit great. xs ordered and length was good but wish the \"swin I wanted to like this top, especially because of its comfortable material and color, but the asymmetrical shape didn\\'t hang well on me. it also runs big - i got a small, and although the bodice fit okay, the sleeves were long, and the bottom of the top looked mishaped and dumpy. this top will be going back. This dress has special written all over it. the poms at the hem and bodice, as well as the rows of black seed beads push are the kind of details that stand out. i like all the varying textures. it looks great with sandals or short boots. fits true to size. a nice sassy length. I\\'ve been waiting to purchase this top for some time, thinking it would be perfect weight for fall/winter. i\\'m pretty disappointed. since i don\\'t live close to an retailer, i typically order a size up to avoid returns and usually end up with items that fit just right or a little loose which is no big deal, this sweater however i was swimming in, like a child in an adult sweater! it was huge! and not to mention unflattering on my short fuller shape. i wasn\\'t impressed with the material either, it f I am 5\\' 10\" 135 lbs, normally a size 4l and ordered both a small in the navy and a medium in the beige. the elastic waist on both is not a tight/ muffin-top producing elastic like on some thinner banded leggings. in fact, the elastic is very loose, not very stretchy on either of the sizes. i think the s had been previously tried on, given the state of the packaging and the fact that the seat of the pant was already a bit stretched out. the m is definitely too large so i would say that these run I had high hopes for this sweater and when i found it on sale online, i jumped at the opportunity. i am 5\\'11\", slender and always wear a small in retailer tops. i purchased this in the mint , size small and as soon as i opened the bag, i had doubts. the fabric is terrible, thin and scratchy. it is not soft and supple as i had imagined. the mint color looks faded and the shape is awful. the length of the arms hits in a bizarre spot, the overall length of the sweater cuts me off at the torso and the Pretty color, great details, awesome stitching.. aaaaannnnnnd it actually not only goes out a line but ballooned out above the hem and then came back in - just too much fabric down below. nice at neck, arms and chest but disastrous anywhere below that. These are really nice pants - color and style are perfect but when i first put them on they seemed like they fit perfectly on me then within 30 minutes they looked 2 sizes too big - they got loose due to the material not being firm or thick enough. i would go down a size for sure. the cons aren\\'t unsolvable so try them out! Didn\\'t work on this curvy gal.\\r\\nsizing up would have helped with the button gaps, but the flowy shape of the blouse would have looked too maternity on a larger size.\\r\\nmajor pass. I bought this on sale thinking it was a great deal, but when it came in i found it to fit like a totally unflattering sack. the pattern didn\\'t help anything, looking totally faded and washed out...the fabric and overall quality is nice, but the fit and pattern are just so..ugly, unfortunately. had to return it. I saw the photo of the young woman wearing this dress in the reviews and she looked beautiful, i on the other hand looked awful. the fabric of the entire dress is quite stiff, so the dress didn\\'t move with me; it sort of felt as if i was wearing a paper cut out. then to contribute to the volume, the sleeve is not set in, it is a raglan style, that on me looked more like a bat suit, than what i was hoping for, a beautiful distinctive dress for an important affair. also the belt didn\\'t enhance the I really wanted to love this dress. i bought it for a photoshoot that will be outdoors, and thought that the green color would be perfect. it is well made, but the fabric is lighter than expected. the biggest issues was the size. i am 5\\'7\" and typically a size ten. i ordered the ten and it fit like a 14-16. it was huge. if you order this, i would say size down two sizes. Love love love this turtleneck! it\\'s soft and cozy, and i\\'ve already reached for it on several chilly days. it definitely runs large. i sized down and it still has an oversized, swingy shape. I was so excited for this kimono. i thought the colors would be lovely. i was looking for a unique wrap/vest/kimono. i ordered this online expecting to be dazzled. sadly, i was not. this arrived and fell short on all measures. the colors were flat, the fabric felt cheap and the construction did not scream $108. it felt like something i would find in a college import/head shop. back it went. i ended up buying the silves wrap, which i love. According to the label, this dress can be hand washed or dry cleaned. i hand washed and line dried per the instructions on the label, and all the seams have completely shrunk and gathered. it looks like there\\'s a drawstring running through every seam. so disappointed in the quality and the labeling. awful! i gave it one extra star because it\\'s cute. When ordering this product, i thought it was strange that the mediums were sold out. i went with the small which is generally what i wear. however, these run small and i see why the medium ran out. they are pretty, however, i wish they made them more true to size. I had high hopes for this sweater and when i found it on sale online, i jumped at the opportunity. i am 5\\'11\", slender and always wear a small in retailer tops. i purchased this in the mint , size small and as soon as i opened the bag, i had doubts. the fabric is terrible, thin and scratchy. it is not soft and supple as i had imagined. the mint color looks faded and the shape is awful. the length of the arms hits in a bizarre spot, the overall length of the sweater cuts me off at the torso and the I ordered this in blue, and loved the color. i\\'m not typically into the flowing top style, but i tried a few items on my last order, this being one. it\\'s unseamed at the bottom, which was my primary reason for returning it - i couldn\\'t see that in the photo online - but if that is your style, this item is good quality, soft, comfortable material, and a great spring or fall blue. I ordered this top online and was hoping to love it, however it didn\\'t fit me properly...the arm holes were much too large (i\\'m typically an xs or small) i ordered the small and based on this fit i don\\'t think the extra small would\\'ve fit either :( also i thought the material seemed very delicate and somewhat thin....and with 3 kids always hanging on me i don\\'t think this top would last very long... The sweater runs large, the sweater is designed in such a way that it looks very sloppy. i would never be able to wear it out of the house. however, the material is exceptionally soft and delightful. keeping as its a great stay at home & lounge sweater, but way over priced for this purpose. if you can get the fabric to lay correctly, you\\'re a genius. Love this top. i ordered the pink and it was more of a dusty rose. it also runs large - i normally wear a medium top. i am going to exchange it for white in small. Size 0 ordered .they fit beautifully for the first 2 hours but slowly stretched out and lost their shape sadly. These are the very stretchy, almost spongy, type fabric.  i ordered my usual size and they fit me like a sausage skin.  crazy small!!! So happy with this jacket! i have looked for what feels like forever for a vegan leather jacket that is (1) long enough in the sleeves and (2) wide enough in the shoulders without being bulky through the body. i found it ran true to size. my usual large for well, xl was a little big. the material is beautiful and soft and the colors are great. i ordered the honey and cognac and love them both. I bought this very cute t-shirt in sky. wore it once, then washed it according to the washing instuctions (machine washable/dryable). this t-shirt turned into a crop top!!!!! i can\\'t wear it. it\\'s going to goodwill. i would suggest that you air dry this shirt, if you want to take the chance that it won\\'t shrink up several inches. This jacket is beautiful. the color is so nice and the cut of the jacket is perfect. however, one i put it on, i couldn\\'t wait to get it off. it\\'s so itchy!! i tried putting on a long sleeve shirt under it but was still uncomfortable. especially around my neck. i wouldn\\'t recommend this jacket based on the material alone. also, the jacket runs large. i\\'m 5\\'1\" 130 lbs 34d and i ordered the small. i would definitely size down. I am six feet tall and this sweater is a perfect fit for tunic length over skinny jeans. if you are shorter i assume it would be longer. i bought the green color which is a beautiful dark hunter green. the bodice is fitted and doesn\\'t show any bra straps and the bottom is slightly loose and forgiving . love this sweater! Love the silhouette and coziness of the fabric. for the first few wearings, i was in love. then it began to pill horribly . . . would not recommend. my mother said, \"that\\'s going to pill up.\" and i ignored her. and she was right. Nicely made, pretty details, but it\\'s cropped fairly short and is rather boxy. wore with orange linen pants and it was cute! Product is sheer, but definitely adorable w/ any jean product! wouldn\\'t pay full price but so glad i got it on sale w/ extra savings!!! The bikini bottoms are high quality and feel very luxurious. order one size up. this line runs small. i read the reviews and ordered a medium. i am normally xs/s in underwear but the medium fits me perfectly. i wish i had ordered in other colors before they sold out! trust me you\\'ll want another pair after trying these on. I wore this bodysuit once. it had a hole under the arm when i took it off A feminine yet mature looking cami. i did not need to wear a bra because the material is thick and stretchy (i am a 34a). it looks great with a pencil skirt as well as chino shorts. feels soft and comfy. can dress it up or down. i took a small and it fit perfectly  (l am 5\\'4\" 120lbs). I ordered the 0p, in red and love these pants. the only problem is even in petites, these are long on me (maybe ok with 4 inch heels). the cut is comfortable and flattering, i have muscular thighs and these fall nicely on me. the color is also nice for this fall. i purchased last year\\'s version (grey and turquoise, but reverse from what is offered this year) and they are very comparable (although i bought them too big last year). fabric not prone to easy wrinkling, highly recommend. (reference 1 I think this top would have been amazing if it was in a jersey or cotton club but the gauzey fabric is so wrinkly and so sheer i don\\'t know how i would use this top. i don\\'t mind most of the slightly sheer retailer tops (if people see my bra slightly so be it) but this is really sheer, unless you are madonna you are going to want to wear something under this, and in my mind, that defeats the purpose of a lightweight, sleeveless top. i returned it and was sorry to have to do that. I loved the fit, color and style, but the fabric seemed very thin and cheap. i was worried that it would tear easily. this is getting returned. The print on this top is even more gorgeous in person. the fit was great, and the removable halter strap is always a plus. this swim top, however, doesn\\'t have padding, and the material is slightly thin, so this could cause an issue for some. overall, however, it looked great. for reference, i am an a cup, and purchase the small. I can always count on retailer to sell unique pieces, so when i saw this sweatshirt online, i ordered it right away.  it&#39;s adorable and quirky, however, when i received it in the mail, it reminded me of something my grandma would wear.  the sleeves are puff sleeves and are really long, while the bottom of the sweatshirt hit pretty high on my waist that when i raised my arms my stomach was showing.  if this was a more tailored sweatshirt, i would be keeping it, but sadly it&#39;s going back. I ordered a regular size s and it was way too boxy for my body type and shorter than the stated length. i don\\'t know if the length stated is from a size m, but the small was definitely shorter (in the front at least).  if you\\'re petite with curves like me, it\\'s not a flattering cut. First of all, this is not pullover styling. there is a side zipper. i wouldn\\'t have purchased it if i knew there was a side zipper because i have a large bust and side zippers are next to impossible for me.\\n\\nsecond of all, the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath.\\n\\nnot at all what is looks like or is described as. sadly will be returning, but i\\'m sure i will find something to exchange it for! This is such a pretty dress. light and flowy. i got it to wear on hot summer days. This wash is so beautiful but i found the rise too long for me. so happy i found them in 24p here on the site. they are wonderful but i\\'d like to caution with respect to proportions:\\r\\n\\r\\ni have long legs (for a petite, ha!) and a petite upper body. these jeans almost entirely differ with respect to length. so id say if the your torso is fairly true to a regular fit, and your legs are shorter, you totally save on hemming the regular fit jeans. like another reviewe noted, hemming will reduce the fl This is such a pretty dress but it didn\\'t do much for my figure.  i\\'m fairly long-waisted and the dress curved in around my lower rib-cage.  also, the beads were falling off everywhere.  i really wanted it to work but it is going back. I ordered my usual medium. the tops length came only to my waist  and was wide and unflatering.   the armholes were right under my arms. too bad as this looked so cute in the picture. i returned. This is festival dress epitomized. flowery, flowy, romantic styling. so many layers in a muted color pattern, but also retains heat since it\\'s all polyester. good thing the skirt is swishy to air your legs out. my distress is regarding the length. petite was sold out so i bought the regular with the intention of wearing platform wedges. it\\'s still too long! if i hem, i will lose a lot of the pretty blue pattern. I loved the photo of this dress. upon examination of the dress (and trying it on) after receiving in the mail, the dress shown online is nothing like the dress i received save for the pattern. the dress i received has a side zip as well as a belt and no pleats on the top. the bottom is also cut straight across not as it appears in the photo. turns out it is not as flattering as it should appear. I loved the dress, but just not dressy enough after rethinking what i needed. very easy order and return. thanks! I tried these on in the store because the pattern of dots caught my eye and it looked like a nice easy style to wear. the waist hits a bit low. i wasn\\'t crazy about the rayon fabric and would prefer it in cotton. i decided to pass on it for now as i don\\'t really need sleep pants; but i might be tempted if they go on sale. Beautiful dress, but has an unflattering fit. i purchased an xs and it\\'s past my knees and the bottom of the dress is so heavy! would be a perfect maternity dress though! I tried in the usual xs but the arm holes were big, and the dress just looked too big for me. i am not sure bout ordering petite as it also may be too short. so i decided to leave this one behind. material is really soft though, and the cut flattering if it fits which is why i recommended. i do have a lot of grey dresses however. for reference i am 5\\'1.5\" and 115 lbs... I ordered a size small. i am 5\\'7\" size 6 and the dress was a mini on me! way shorter than on the taller model. the stomach and hips gaped out from my body yet the waist was cut way too high, so the dress was both too small and too big! very odd fit. the material is soft, thick, stretchy and has a textured pattern which i liked. this one is going back. I was minimally torn over whether to return this but ultimately it\\'s going back because the knit is just too thin. i thought it would be cozy and be of normal sweater weight but it\\'s not. and because it\\'s so light, the swing effect doesn\\'t really come off. nothing special. Beautifully made, incredible beadwork and detail. sleeves are extra long and a bit heavy (and cinched in multiple places, which feels strange), but the blouse is *gorgeous* and absolutely perfect for autumn. i\\'m gonna return and buy the size down. Received this yesterday, wearing it today and am happy.  it&#39;s warm and cozy - perfect blend of sweatshirt and sweater for when you want to be comfortable, yet still look like you tried. i&#39;m 5&#39;4.5&quot; and 130 lbs. i ordered an xs and it&#39;s still pretty roomy which is how i think it&#39;s supposed to fit. i would prefer it to be a little more form fitting, but not enough to send back.  great with skinny jeans and boots. I looked at this dress for a long time before i purchased it because of the money. i wear a size 2p. was entirely disappointed in the style and construction of this dress. for one thing the lining is bulky and you could never wear it in warmer weather without burning up. the dress as pictured looks very feminine and light weight silk but there is just too much material going on--- thick and heavy. the overall fit was too big and very unflattering. This dress has become a favorite in my rotation. the cut and print flatter my body and accentuate my waist. the print is subtle enough to pair with bold accessories. I purchased this shirt in blue hoping it would be a basic add-on to my wardrobe. it\\'s been about a month and i have since washed and worn it twice. the color is now fading and i found a hole in the front of the shirt! i\\'m not sure if its the fine fabric that caused it to tear, but i washed it on gentle cycle and didn\\'t do anything that would have warranted a tear. sadly this did not serve up to its purpose. i wouldn\\'t suggest paying the price tag or even sale price for an item that i don\\'t expec This was was a great buy! i got in on sale and the quality is really excellent. the material is thick and stretchy. there is a spanx like liner which is really nice as well for smoothing out the bumps. the dress style and cut is very slimming. i am more a size 14 (at 5\\'10\") and the 12 fit well. i agree with the other reviewer regarding the twisted shoulder. it doesn\\'t lay on me either like it does on the model, but it doesn\\'t detract from the dress so its a keeper given the other positives. This dress is gorgeous. more ivory in person. the crochet is amazing. i sized up from my normal s to a m, only bc i wanted a loose fit. and after reading reviews that it fit a little bit like a shift, i wanted a bigger size. but a small would have prob worked as well. depends on how you want this to fit. i love it. i wear mine now w a cropped jean jacket and leggings, soon w just sandals. great transition piece bc it\\'s a slightly heavy dress but not enough to be overwhelming or hot for the summe What a find! this skirt is so soft and fits like a dream. perfect shape and length. i\\'ve been looking for more pieces to match a couple of fabulous pairs of purple shoes i have, so this is just the ticket! I love charlie trousers. i must have 8 pair. i sometimes have bought a particular style in every color. that being said, i love these for the fabric, and general overall fit. pattern is on trend in color and versatility. i wore them out on saturday to a casual restaurant, and today at work with a business like blouse and cardigan. but, i hate the side zip. i generally hate invisible zippers period, because they tend to get caught at seams, and i have had them break on other garments. this one is This dress is beautifully made, but it does not flair slightly as in the photo, it stick out like a tent. it might be a good maternity dress. the fabric is somewhat stiff andheavy with a slight texture. I just got this dress and am so excited to have it hanging in my closet, i\\'ve been eyeing it for a long time and am glad i got it on sale. i felt like a greek goddess when i tried this on and cannot wait to wear it. it fits like it was made just for me. the outer material is a little heavier than expected but it not a problem, the second layer is form fitting and soft. i feel like the restricted opening at the bottom forces me to slow down, like a lady and take in my surroundings, after all life This is the most unflattering peplum top i have ever tried on. fit perfectly as a size 6 should in the arms, shoulder, chest... then the waist was huge! just hung off of me like a flour sack. it was wider than the chest measurements, which made me appear frumpy instead of tailored and classic. combine that with the high-low hemline and it looked like a project runway reject. sent back immediately, do not buy this if you have (or want to appear to have) an hourglass figure, it will do nothing for This one will be going back. the color is really blah and the fabric wasn\\'t a texture i was expecting--it is kind of thick and ribbed and i suspect it would stretch out over the course of the day. overall, the cut and style is cute, but i just felt like i was wearing a hospital gown with the combination of the fabric and the style. this may have been cute in a more vibrant color and lighter weight fabric. I was very disappointed with my recent retailer order. i ordered the meleri eyelet tank and it had a stain on the front. i also order a dress that came with a tear in the fabric. sale items should not be damaged unless the customer is aware of the damage and accepts it in that condition. very disappointing. Great little black dress for cooler evenings with boots, or dress down with a pair of flats for daytime. perfect fall dress! I don\\'t think they are an easy fit cut, they are more like skinny jeans. as i was looking for something more relaxed i decided to return them. the quality of the material is good, the color is nice. I though this dress would be similar to the turtleneck swing dress by maeve. it\\'s not. first of all, it runs very large. i purchased a small (i am usually a xs or small in maeve, i purchased a small in the turtleneck swing dress). the shoulders were very wide, you had to manually cross the fabric around your neck but it didn\\'t lay as flat as what i wanted around my chest, and it was quite large around my rib cage and stomach making it rather shapeless. i really wanted this dress to work (i love This is different from any bra i\\'ve had before, in a good way. the lace over the front is really beautiful, and no annoying straps means it\\'s comfortable! fit and support are both great. i didn\\'t notice that it was silk when i ordered, so it was a nice surprise to open something so luxe and elegant. i wasn\\'t expecting an underwire, either, based on the s-m-l sizing, but it has one. Love the tegan tunic version of this dress. i assumed since it looked identical except for the length that the sizing was the same but i was wrong. this runs so big! i got a s in the tegan but the s in this dress looked like an oversized potato sack on. i highly recommend ordering at least 2 sizes down unless you want to look tent-y. Loved the bright pattern online and had hoped it had a similar fit to the tyla ts which i love. in actuality this was a lot boxier. the cut was shorter in length, too short for my 5\\'10 frame. the width was rather boxy and unflattering, particularly with the wide arm holes and flat cuffed sleeves. also the pattern looked a little cheap in person, way less spectacular than retailers typical gorgeous vibrant patterns. this is going back i\\'m afraid. Looks great on. i am 5\\'11 and the length is perfect hits above the knee but not too short. also room in the chest area. This top was quite voluminous when i purchased it and i sized down to an xs, however after hand washing it once in cold water it has shrunk significantly. it still fits, but something to be aware of. Agree with above review. these are described totally wrong. they are not 8.5 rise. they are very high rise, so much that i didnt even try them on...the color isnt good either, it looks like a cheap levi\\'s color or just not a quality denim. if you like high rise, you might like them. i can\\'t comment on fit.. First off, this runs very large. i\\'m normally an 8 and sized down to the 6 but probably could have done a 4. it looked like a tent on me. the top part is lovely, i just think the bottom is way to large and not flattering. this one is definitely going back especially with all the white dress options they have out now. Let me start off my saying that i hate pants. i will wear dresses and skirts whenever possible to avoid them. however, i found these at my local retailer and just had to try them on because the pattern was so adorable. i have another pair of pilcro shorts that i love because they are so comfortable and have so much stretch to them that they don\\'t make me crazy like other pants do. these were no exception! i love everything about them and am going to have a hard time not wanting to wear them every Little clack dress. classic shape but is pretty low in the v neck. i am busty (34dd) and need a \"push-up\" bra to make the neckline close. it\\'s very easy to wear and super comfy. This is really a lovely jumper and looks quite nice and dressy on. my problem is a short torso, but then again this may be made for short torso loving people! i felt like i was all legs in it. i never asked anyone else\\'s opinion, though, so not sure if its just me and my complex.\\nif you don\\'t have a short torso,then you might experience the pulling the others were speaking about because the waist might hit you higher than your usual waist.\\n\\noverall, i am not sure who this was designed for.. but If i stopped eating for a couple of months or jumped into a time machine and set the dial for 1990 i would really enjoy this beautifully made delicate blouse. the problem area is evident looking at the photo --the tiny tight fitted gorgeous bodice. i will keep this piece becasue i love it so and the apocolypse is apparently imminent and i have hardly any food in the house. I loved the way this shirt looked when i tried it on in the store buto when i got home i realized it\\'s extremely sheer. you can\\'t wear a white bra with it, for example because it will show through. taking it back. This top is tight across the bust (i am a 32dd cup) and more trapeze-shaped than the picture shows. if you are smaller busted, it may not flare out as much.\\nalso- the sz 10 is what was tight - and i usually wear a sz. 4 or 6, or small-size top/blouse.\\nin the end, this wasn\\'t very flattering as it looked more like a maternity top. I tried these shorts on in 5 colors and found a wide variety of sizing. in the dark grey and taupe i needed to size down one from my usual 28 to a size 27. in the sapphire, lavender and red my regular size 28 fit perfectly. i ended up purchasing the dark grey and lavender with a discount. i gave 4 stars for the variation in sizing but once i got the correct fit the shorts have not stretched out on me throughout the day in either color. the length is perfect, short enough to not look frumpy, but This is the tiniest blazer i\\'ve ever purchased in a size 10. i usually wear an 8, but sized up based on other reviews and it was still too small. it\\'s very attractive but please size true to size I love the fabric and pattern of this dress so much that i decided to keep it (got it on mega sale), but i would have never paid full price or anything close. the armholes are enormous, showing bra and all. i am not particularly large chested (34c), and the buttons are stretched to gaping on me, even with the huge armholes. i have a cute red sweater coat that i will wear over it all fall, but i could not recommend it because of the poor cut design.\\n\\npros: great pattern, fabric, pockets, true to I just bought this and i really disagree with previous review that it runs big - i wear an 8 in skirts and bought another retailer skirt last week that fits just fine - this one does not even zip up. i might exchange for bigger size, as label is just a number to me and sizes are really inconsistent - or it may just go back. Best beachy summer tunic in the store. can be worn knotted at the hip or worn straight. can be worn over jeans, shorts, a bathing suit, take your pick. wear it with a tank/cami underneath or not. it works wither way. asymmetrical cut. great for us long-legged tall people. fabulous buy. only con is that it\\'s a tad delicate. unfinished hem and loose-knit. will easily snag if you aren\\'t mindful. i recommend hand wash, air dry. I\\'m baffled why none of the other reviewers have mentioned how large these pants are. i ordered the petite small, and i\\'m always a small. these are huge. i felt like i had on a large. i like the thin material and color, and i\\'m sad that they are so large. I\\'ve been looking for a black off-the-shoulder dress and found this baby in store today. for reference, i am 5\\'8\", 34b, 140-150 and took a small. this dress is a shift/swing style, so if you\\'re looking for something fitted this isn\\'t your dress. as another reviewer mentioned, ladies who are busty may not like this as the ruffle at the top could add unwanted volume. if you are extremely thin or petite, i might size down, but i like my clothing loose vs. fitted so i kept the small. the fabric is g It\\'s a perfectly cute simple summer dress, but the only reason i\\'m even considering keeping it is because it was a gift. the material is fine but for this price, i expect something more exciting than what is, really, just a modified t-shirt dress. at least more exciting colors or a print or something. the top piece is 2 full layers which could get warm in the summer, and the ribbing is tight enough that you have to wear a bra even if you\\'re small-chested (i\\'m a 32b and super thin and still neede One can\\'t tell from the picture but the top shoulder part is sheet and transparent. it also is very long almost dress length.  feels less quality than what retailer usually carries. These jeans didn\\'t fit like i thought , based on the model. i usually wear 25 , but these were snug and i i have snug jeans , lots of them and i wanted looser , flared jeans ,kind of a 60\\'s look. not these. a bigger size wouldn\\'t have improved it . they are a perfectly good jean , love the color but not what i wanted . This dress didn\\'t work for me for several reasons, but i knew i wouldn\\'t keep it as soon as i saw the ribbing on the neck and arms, which makes an otherwise flexibly styled dress (dress up/dress down) into super casual only (plus it looks cheap). it is also not for the long waisted or tall.\\r\\n\\r\\non the plus side, the fabric feels great, and it hangs well. I bought this online so didn\\'t realize that the fabric at the bottom is very, very stiff. i was expecting something silky, or at least on the softer and more moveable side. the best description i can think of is an overly starched mens dress shirt. that being the case, it kind of juts out in weird places. the sweater part is very nice, but it is somewhat closer fitting than what it seems in the picture. the fabric bottom is too ample for the slimmer design of the sweater which just adds to the o I was so excited to order this sweater but was so disappointed when it came. the knit is somewhat stiff and the sleeves are not as bell shaped as pictured on the model. overall i would of kept it if it were much less money, for the price it is just an ordinary sweater with no style. Tried this on in the store - i love the colors but the cut was just not flattering. the liner was fine, but the dress flared out excessively and looked like a tent. tried it with a belt for some definition but the fabric was too thick. The top is totally see through and fabric some what itchy.  it also feels cheap to the touch.  i love the idea but can\\'t keep it for this price...i\\'m a shorty so i\\'d have to hem it too! sadly will return. This dress looked gorgeous in the monthly catalog. ordered in hopes to wear in easter. i felt it was frumpy and just ok. color was pretty but overall; i didn\\'t love it like i hoped to. I really wanted to like this top. in person though, the fit was too large and boxy. i did order a smaller size based on other reviews but it was still too sacklike. i got the grey motif pattern which i thought was quite pretty and interesting. the material was nice and lightweight. perhaps it would look better on someone with a straight figure and small bust. Run large and leg is very wide. even sizing down, they seemed too floppy. I ordered this in a small and medium hoping one would work, but the previous reviews were exactly correct, the bodice is way too small in proportion to the rest of the jumpsuit. the bottom has lots of fabric, which wouldn\\'t be bad except you have to go up a size to make the bodice fit, then the bottom becomes overwhelming. i am 5\\'5\" and 115 so i have a slim build and couldn\\'t get the bodice to zip in a small. the medium would have needed altering, which wouldn\\'t have fixed the extra fabric on th I love this t-shirt! it is so soft, fits true to size and great with jeans or shorts. i purchased in yellow and plan to purchase other colors! Love the nautical vibe, perfect for summer wear. the knit top with cap sleeves is easy to wear and not clingy for those with limps and bumps. the asymmetrical skirt has a flare which again makes this dress easy and comfortable to wear.  i\\'m usually a size 8, 36-29-40 and the medium fit my hourglass shape perfectly. I tried on the regular size at my store and it was too long for me, te sleeves were enourmous, and the dress fell mid-calf. but, i love the feel of hte mateiral, and if it were to fit properly, is very falttering. i will order the petite size later on to try, i liked it enough for that. the \"blue\" is a nice teal color. double layer, and extremely comfortable. the finish is laser cut, no stichting. I loved the design and look to this shirt, but it ran way big for me. i loved the forgiving fit, but it just wasn\\'t flattering at all. i even went down one size and it still was huge. sad to send this one back. Gorgeous color and fit, but fabric is not great. i ordered this to wear with leggings and booties. i returned as i could tell it would get baggy in the elbows and rear end. just not a good fabric. bummer!!!! This jacket is surprisingly soft and comfy. i\\'d been debating getting a leather jacket in this style but when i saw this it seemed a great option. seems to be very versatile. I ordered the black and white shirt thinking it was polka dots, but turned out to be stars instead which was even cuter. fits true to size and is very soft and comfortable. my first thought after trying it on was that i should have ordered another one! This dress looked gorgeous in the monthly catalog. ordered in hopes to wear in easter. i felt it was frumpy and just ok. color was pretty but overall; i didn\\'t love it like i hoped to. When i wore this the two times i did, i got a ton of compliments. it runs small, and is a bit tight when sized correctly but its really stunning. after the second wear, the fabric under the arms frayed and its now unwearable. i have to return it and am so disappointed. sadly, i would not recommend buying it for that reason. I don\\'t mind loose-fitting clothing, but to say that this product runs large is an understatement. no amount of pulling, tying, pinching could help me get this jacket to fall the way it does on the model in the photo. the arm holes are a foot in diameter for artistic purposes, and the jacket itself is meant to flow far away from the body, i guess. if you try to taper it in with the strings, then end result resembles a rounded beach ball. very disappointed, especially since the design on the fabr I found these to fit odd. i am also use to wearing the skinny jeans so trying a wide leg was a bit weird anyway. the placement of the pockets and the way it hit my waist was awkward and not flattering. i am usually a 8/10 and the 8 fit but just did not look good. I love cloth and stone and the softness and prettiness of this fabric did not disappoint. this is not a dress, however. it is a long shirt. the sides were so short the you could see where my bum and hamstrings came together. leggings would ruin the look and as a shirt it would be totally impractical. for reference i am 5\\'8\" and 130 lbs. the small was the correct size, save for the length. This dress fit so oddly. i tried on two different sizes and both did this super unflattering poochy thing at the belly. the dress wasn\\'t tight at my hips in either size, it was just that there was weird extra fabri right around the midsection that stuck out. maybe i was too short? couldn\\'t figure it out. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe color and detailing are beautiful though! a little tight in the bust. I ordered this to arrive at my store and was so excited to try it on. it was soft and cuddly, but a little baggy under the arms, and it shed everywhere. underwhelmed. I was apprehensive because of the long tail at the back of this shirt, but it is very pretty with capris. Sadly, going back. ordered m, light color option, very difficult to pull over my head, not a good sign. got it on and neckline looked attractive (height w/o being a mock turtle), but whole thing a bit small around middle. could order the l, but i\\'m not liking the feeling of the fabric, it feels tight with restrictive and nonuniform stretch: 33 cotton/27 poly/27 acrylic and 95 rayon/5 spandex \"contrast\", which must mean the stripes. combine w/fact that the two wide stripes are right at my middle 1. the wide leg/crop is a cool trend. but not great on me. i\\'m pretty standard in size/build: 5\\'6\", 135 lbs,, size 4. i felt like i just looked oddly shaped with them on.\\r\\n2. and maybe this is the issue: the size 27 (my normal size in every citizen pant i own) was about 2 whole sizes too big for me. i mean, i felt great about myself. but...wowza.\\r\\n3. when i took them to the store to try on/exchange, they don\\'t even carry them in the store! so i just returned and will try something else. I purchased this dress on super sale and i\\'m so happy i did. it looks better on me than on the model and that\\'s never the case. the material is soft corduroy with comfortable give. it moves with me. true to size (i ordered a size 8 and for reference, i\\'m 5\\'2\", 140lbs, 36c). love this staple fall/winter piece. i wore it to a conference for work with footless tights and a black cardigan. i can\\'t say enough how comfortable it is on! it has a structured give if that makes any sense. love it! Another cloth and stone success! love the back! denim goes with most anything! I initially liked the feel and quality of the top but once it was on it was much shorter and looser than the picture of the model. it flowed out from my chest with one central pleat in the front and my husband said it made me look pregnant. then came the tedious task of taking it off with such a snug fit in the shoulders. i\\'m regularly a size 2/xs, 32d and 120 lbs and both size 2 and 4 did not work for me. I am typically a 14-16 and the dress is true to size. (xl) i live that the embroidery runs the full length of the dress. i also like the shimmery side seam detail. the front cut near the shoulders is very flattering on. one minor issue is a gap in the bosom area due to button placement. however, i plan to add a snap t i fix. i often have this issue as i am large in that area. the length is flattering as well and provides great coverage in the rear. lightweight and flows nicely. the color is wond I adore this blouse. the colors are vibrant (see my photo below). this is one of my favorite purchases from retailer. the top is light weight. true to size. i ordered a petite small and am 5 feet tall 120 lbs. and curvy. i left it untucked and loose like in the photo and it was very flattering. i disagree about it being frumpy. i wore it with kelly green retailer brand slacks paired with the retailer yellow sweater coat with white piping, and the retailer moss suede cross bag and neutral color (nude) fl The fabric on this shirt was beautifully woven and so soft/cozy. but the shirt was so wide! i\\'m 5\\'2\", 103lbs and got an xs. there was room for two of me in there. it draped very well, but instead of looking slouchy and cool, it just looked too big. so, back it goes. I think the orange top will look great in the fall as well as spring. i\\'m 5\\' 7.5\" and it\\'s a great tunic length on me. it\\'s really pretty and i love it. snap it up on sale! Not as cute as photos, and too small in chest. i am 5\\'5\\'\\', 125 lbs, and the small was too tight in the chest, and i am not large here at all. shoulders and sleeve length fit well. will return. not comfortable, and will need to be able to button it on rainy days. It\\'s short and wide. not a good combo for anyone who isn\\'t stick thin. I got this sweater in the neutral color, which is very versatile. it is truly, beautifully soft and the design is very pretty -- i really like the different material of the arms and v-neck. the length is good, too, if you like longer sweaters, as i do. the downside: it sheds so badly! sweater is just everywhere after putting it on. i don\\'t think i could wear it out of the house for this reason. another reviewer suggested taking a tape roller to it to make it wearable, but i think that would take I bought these almost immediately after touching them in store; they were so soft i didn\\'t even need to try them on to know i would love them. i now wish i had tried them on in the store, so i could have learned that the elastic band on the inside isn\\'t sown in, meaning the band will constantly twist and get tangled whenever i put them on/take them off. it\\'s unbelievably annoying. i have to fix them every time i wear them. if i had known this i don\\'t know if i would have purchased them. they are The geometrical pattern of this sweater is slightly asymmetrical, with nice geometry to it. the colors are more muted and subtle as compared to the picture. i was very excited to see it through its transparent bag. unfortunately my delight faded after i pulled the sweater out. first, it weighs a ton. a thread for each color runs around he whole sweater, hence much more thread went into it than in a typical sweater. second, it runs large. i am usually an xl or 16-18, but this sweater has lost of Dress is beautiful in person, light material that is excellent for summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis dress is not forgiving in the chest, so ladies if you bigger chested i suggest going up a size or two. i\\'m 5\\'4, 145 lbs and 34ddd, i usually wear 8 or 10, this dress in a 10 made my look like i was wearing an unflattering sports bra. Pretty design and good quality but the medium was very balloony at the bottom. fit my chest alright (34c) but flared out way too much at the bottom. I purchased the grey in a medium, i normally wear an 8 or 10 in tops, 36 c.. i found it to fit quite well, but it has the shape that seems common at retailer lately in that it is shorter and more boxy. so if you have a longer torso(like me), you may not be the happiest. i loved the lace and didn\\'t have an issue with that area being sheer, but the non-lace part is very thin. i did try it on with a black bra and it was obvious i was wearing black all around, you could even see the width of th Cute top but started disintegrating after two washes. the delicate cutouts in the top tore apart. i machine washed it in the gentle cycle and didn\\'t use the dryer. disappointed to have to discard the top after just buying it. I purchased this jacket in my local store. size 10 and runs really small . i love the color combination and design but the fabric in my opinion is poor quality. i have seen a lot of retailer use this poly spun knit in so much of their items and the jacket after bringing it home and looking in the light was already showing pilling. looks like it is worn in an bad way. returned the next day. this was a big disappointment and every time i see this fabric being used in retailer clothes it makes me mad. I fell in love with this trench when i first saw it online but ended up returning it once i tried it on. i\\'m 5\\'9, 140 lbs and the m fit true to size. but the belt hit above my natural waistline and the skirt of the coat was much fuller than i expected, making me look heavier. the material also wrinkles easily and the stitching was poor quality with lots of loose threads. disappointed, as the color and concept were great. This dress is flattering and seems to be made well. the polka dots add interest. i am usually a 2 and did go up to a 4 in this. . It seems like most people love this tee, so you might as well. i returned it because i didn\\'t like how the front hung. if the front was as long as the back, i would have kept it. or, if the front was short enough to wear with thick pants, untucked, i might have kept it (seems like this top would only look good with leggings or skirts). i do like the material, though. it\\'s very thin and looks great in the shoulder and neck area. and i liked how the back of the shirt looked when i tried wearing it I didn\\'t want to get the black carissima because i already own the mona, so when i saw this gorgeous marguerite for sale, i had to bite. the main colors are chocolate brown, copper and rose pink--such a beautiful combination. the hook I grabbed this dress to try on in my usual size, because i needed to see what the hype was about this style of dress, and it left me puzzled.  the print was pretty, but no amount of tailoring could save it for me.  it was wearing me.  maybe it could wear three of me.  i feel like this is a way for clothing manufacturers to cut corners, by making a garment without details (no installing more time consuming zippers, buttons or snaps, and making something that fits a wide range of sizes because it I was disappointed with the style and quality of this dress. it poofs out funny in the waste and it just looks very unflattering. i\\'m sending it back. Didn\\'t love it, didn\\'t hate, rather indifferent. the grey was a little more muted than i wanted for a summer tee.\\r\\ni\\'m 5\\'4\", 123lbs, 34a, the xs fit if it wouldn\\'t shrink, if you\\'re about this size but larger busted go with the s. I\\'d hoped these would be cozy and warm. the fabric is thin and slinky. it grabs and emphasizes every bump and roll. couldn\\'t wait to get them off. just horrible. and that price is very steep. can\\'t recommend. I didn\\'t mind the \"scratchiness\" others proclaimed this garment had, but it is made very tight in the arms and across the back. looks great from the front, but uncomfortable. I was so excited to order this beautiful coat.  it does seem well made and is very soft.  unfortunately, the fit is completely off and is overall large.  i ordered a small, as this coat appears slightly more snug on top, a-line on the bottom, with three buttons.  i am 5\\'6\" and weigh approximately 145.  i was expecting this coat to be body-skimming.  instead it was overall large and the bottom of the coat awkwardly flared.  the  pleat on the back is unflattering.  sadly going back. This model looks like a bauble head. she is absolutely too thin and sends the wrong message out to retailer shoppers. this last catalog\\'s models are anorexic and unhealthy looking.\\r\\n\\r\\ni ordered this shirt hoping it would fit, but it\\'s too small for 34dd. i am tall athletic and have breasts. \\r\\ni think of my shape as average - and the top didn\\'t fit. it\\'s cut narrow and small. Dress is comfortable, feels great and the fit exceeds flattery. the length hits just above my knees and the small side triangle cutouts add a unique cute, fun but still classic detail that i didn\\'t notice in the picture online. i love this dress and get so many compliments. I bought this shirt after reading so many positive reviews. it looks much thinner and cheaper than the photo depicts.  like many reviewers have said, it does hit just above midriff but the fringe covers your belly.  it didn&#39;t hang right on me and i felt like i was wearing a rug. I was very disappointed in the quality of this top. the first time i wore it it snagged right in the front. i had to pull the thread under so it wasn\\'t exposed. i put it in the wash in the gentle cycle and it was destroyed with several more snags when i removed it from the machine. this top is extremely delicate and doesn\\'t withstand normal everyday casual wear although it\\'s s casual lightweight sweater. now it\\'s just a wear around the house ratty throw around shirt. I love pilcros and tried everything to get these to work. one size down, two sizes down, no matter what, they just don\\'t look right. the droopy look didn\\'t work for me. These jeans are so cute! they are perfect for petites too! i am fit, look way younger than my age and get so many compliments when i wear these jeans. i\\'m. i\\'m 5\\'2\", 115 libs and they definitely fit tight in a good way. just like the photo pretty much. they are not small like the white mother ankle fray jeans for sale on the site now. those definitely run smaller so these are true to size with a tight fit. Love this skirt. i wore it to work after purchasing this, and i had at least 20+ people comment on how beautiful it is. many office ladies asked where i purchased it and one (who asked the cost) said it was worth the steep price. the green in this skirt really pops out, as do the gorgeous golden flowers. the pockets are a nice addition as well. The pattern \"camouflages\" my curvy figure :-) . the fabric is very soft, great for lounging. i wish the fabric offered a little more support though for working out. I never write reviews, but i just purchased this top at full price last week in the store. it\\'s not a have to have top just to look at it, but once i put it on i had to have it. it\\'s extremely comfortable and i am able to wear it while running around with my boys and still feel as though i\\'m put together. \\r\\n\\r\\ni\\'ve worn this top now 2 times and after the 2nd wear i have 3 holes in the area where the waist line of my jeans sits. the first time i wore this top it was for only and hour or so. what a There was. a blue one in my store sale room and i decided to try it on, as i had read great review. bummer is i really do need hte petite in this. cut is flattering, adn material softer that i thought. next year... I order the blue and orange endora wing dress in an xxs and it was still very large. i know that this is a flow dress but there was so much excess material that i looked like i was swallowed. the colors are more muted than in the pictures, a faded blue and orange that i didn\\'t really like. return. True to size until it met the laundry! let my disappointment be a lesson -- $80 for a blouse that i no longer recognize. i washed this item as indicated by the care instructions and it shrunk by at least 30%. dry clean this garment, or spot clean at best. This dress is very pretty and feminine but was unfortunatly much too large for me. i ordered my regular xs and it was swimming on me. i also found the embroidery to be imperfect in several places (unraveling) and the placement of the embroidered designs were uneven at the bottom of the dress, which threw off the flow. the largest medallion was off center in the front of the dress and gave it a crooked effect. the material is nice and the pockets are a plus but i returned it. The style of this dress is quite lovely, i immediately gravitated towards it when i saw in the store, however once i tried it on it looked like a sack of potatoes...unfortunately the loose silhouette did not do anything for my figure, i should mention that i am 5\\'9\" and have an athletic figure but with hips. \\r\\nthe design is very on trend and the dress does have some lovely details like the lace around the hip area and flowy fabric. but unfortunately it was not enough for me to purchase. also the The embroidery on this was beautiful but didn\\'t hang well on my athletic/small chested upper body. Saw this at the store and it is breathtaking in person. as the previous reviewer stated, i too consider this a dress and not a tunic, and it\\'s not really crinkled either. the dress is structured, very soft, and so gorgeous on. i tried on a regular x-small and it fit but a bit uncomfortable at the mid section. the small fit better (it\\'s meant to be a bit loose, bohemian looking) and the hem falls right at my knees which is perfect for the office (i\\'m 5\\'2\", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). i have medium o Saturday/sunday never disappoints! love this black cardigan. runs a tad large i noticed in the arm length for me. not a problem anywhere else though. good medium weight to the fabric. durable quality and waist flattering once tied. great for throwing on over a dress, wearing with a t-shirt I love the pattern on this jacket and enjoy the bell shape. a fun jacket to through on and add quick style to a skinny pants. So sad becuase i like the design. i would not recomend the lack to anyone that does not live and work and shop in a completely immaculate environment. i wore this to work the day after purchasing and within three hours i honestly looked like i had slept in this sweater for three monthe straight. i had to take the sweater off and work in a t-shirt. \\r\\nthe marigold color may be better than the black abut showing lint but something intrinsic to the fabric really attracts lint like nothing i have eve I am 6\\' and typically wear a size 8-10. i am a rather busty kind of gal (36h), so i usually order larges in tops so that i am sure there is no pull across my chest. i ordered a large in this top in the plum color. when i received the top, i could not stop laughing at how huge it was... the fit in the chest area is fine, but i can wrap the sides around me and tie them into a bow. at least half of the material needs to be removed! despite how huge the top is, it is very cute otherwise! i just mail I usually have a hard time with the sizing as retailer carries so many designers but this dolan top fits absolutely true to size. i am an xs and it fits perfectly, drapes exactly as shown and overall, looks exactly as pictured. the color is an off-white with gold beading and tiny white sequins on a mesh overlay which is lined so there is no show-through which i was concerned about. it is not boxy due to the fabric which is very soft and drapes nicely over your curves. there is just enough b I love these. i like that they\\'re fancier than your basic summer shorts but they still look casual and effortless. unlike the other reviews i found that they run large. i\\'m usually a 4, maybe a 6, and the 4 is roomy.  still looks good though just rides a bit lower on my hips. I didn\\'t realize that the grey sleeves are attached (i assumed that was just an undershirt on the model). needless to say it looks cheap and poorly made. will be returning I have purchased a lot from retailer but lately, some of the items have been disappointing in quality.verses cost, this being one. the picture is nice but the actual blouse is nothing like this. the size was not accurate so buy a size bigger because of the sleeves. I really like the look of these socks, and have become obsessed we over-the-knee socks for winter this year. they are very tick which is nice for keeping warm and for durability for a long lasting product. my only complaint is that they are very difficult to get over the knee. this can be a great thing, because they certainly do stay put-which is a huge problem with over-the-knee socks. however, by the end of the day i was pretty sure i was going to lose a leg from poor circulation.\\n\\ni am still I am reasonably petite, but i like sweaters very oversized and large, so i ordered this sweater in a large. i was very disappointed when the sweater came because while the sleeves and upper chest area were in large, the length of the sweater did not at all increase when the size did. because the lower part of the sweater did not increase in size, the sweater ended up looking very awkward, with the chest and sleeves very large and long but then a very tight and short (waist-length) stomach. i do I loved this dress and the color. i wanted to wear it to my niece\\'s wedding. i usually wear a medium but couldn\\'t get it on. the large was perfect in the top but too tight in the hips for a wedding even with spanks. the xl was perfect is the hips in that it didn\\'t cut, but the top was huge. i really don\\'t understand the sizing of this dress at all. I ordered the black and white shirt thinking it was polka dots, but turned out to be stars instead which was even cuter. fits true to size and is very soft and comfortable. my first thought after trying it on was that i should have ordered another one! Fabric felt and looked cheap.  hem was completely frayed, all the way around, perhaps purposely, but ratty looking, all the same. I am very disappointed with this order. the shirt looks and feels cheap, is not flattering in any way. i am sending it back right away. In a sea of dresses, this is the one that caught my eye in the whole store. i am a pear shape, and ended up trying both the medium and the large, taking the medium home. it was super flattering on, and was an appropriate length to pair with tights.\\n\\nhere\\'s where the problem happened. i wanted to wear this dress for thanksgiving, i put it on, and as i tightened the drawstring to cinch in the waist - riiiiiiiiiip! the drawstring ripped through the fabric at the waistband. so disappointed. I ordered this top in size xl. there is a lot of excess material below the empire waist so it flows out too much. this accentuated my pear-shape and was unflattering. the sizing on the top portion & sleeves was true-to-size. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe material is so rough, scratchy & uncomfortable. they should have used a softer fabric. the pattern alignment is terrible on the one i received. at $100, i hoped the plaid would have flowed in a continuous, matching line. i didn\\'t notice the mismatched sleeves of the This poncho is lovely. i found it fits perfectly. im 5\\'4\", 125 and got the xs/s..just long enough (loke jacket length) and the hood doesnt add extra weight (doesnt drag it down the back). arm holes are approriate size. very cool piece for any weather layering. I am ever in search of a light, white, summer top. this is not quite it. there are two distinct layers, and each of them is the scratchy, starchy type of gauze. it would just roast me in the summer sun--but i run fairly hot in general. Amazing dye so unique\\r\\nyou can put in washing machine no prob make sure you put in dryer with a non static dryer sheet for the dress to be super soft I was looking for a dress that had a lot of color. since i usually stick to neutrals, this was out of my comfort zone, but i found this one and loved it. it\\'s comfortable, not clingy, and i can wear a regular bra (bonus!). i wish the waist wasn\\'t dropped, but i think it worked well. i plan on wearing it more in the spring/summer, dressing it up or down will be easy. \\r\\n\\r\\ni\\'m usually a size 12 and this fit true to size. If the sweater looked as it does in the picture, i would keep it. however, it was very boxy and short, a style that does not work for me at all. i\\'m 5 ft. 6 in. and ordered the medium. i suspect the sweater on the model may be clipped back to make it look more form fitting. unfortunately i will have to return the sweater. Another great whimsical print by maeve! as of late, this brand has really fallen all over the board for me, but this top had the right fabric, fit, and pattern to hold onto the parrot print. it looks great loose or tucked in. the parrot print has plenty of accent colors to make this match with many things. cute! I really liked this cardigan when i saw it today. the cut and detail in the back is slimming and very flattering. i love the idea of the safety pin closure, and i really like how the model wears it in this photo-open with the pin on the side. when i saw this in-store, it was closed in the front with the pin, which i also like. i thought for sure the cardigan was also pinned in back when i saw it in the model, so it looked fantastic. however, when i tried it on myself, it wasn\\'t quite the same. Disappointed this didn\\'t fit better. the pockets stuck out on the sides, and it was baggy through the middle. you could also see the pockets through the outer layer of the dress. the color is more like a chartreuse than the picture. it\\'s really pretty! Wanted to love this dress - pretty fabric and colors. i think it would be more flattering on a taller woman (i\\'m 5\\'3\", ordered a s), this just looked like a nightgown on me. sorry to say it\\'s going back. I am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra. it\\'s soft and fits okay, but it has zero support or shape. i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support. if i would have seen this is the store, i would have passed over it. however, i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it. it\\'s comfortable so that\\'s a redeeming quality. i would not recommend for larger chested ladies, though! I\\'m still on the fence about these. i realize they got great reviews but i thought they would be a bit thicker. they just feel too flimsy and too much like i\\'m ready for bed. i was looking for more lounge pants that i felt like if i needed to run up to the store on a saturday afternoon that i wasn\\'t wearing pjs. i just can\\'t get past that. they are totally cute but i was definitely looking for more summer lounge-wear.\\r\\n\\r\\ni ordered the small which fit fine. i wear 4-6 in retailer pants. i got the p Very cool dress. very true to size--fits just right in the top. the fabric is just right--not too heavy but opaque enough to cover everything that needs covering. only issue is that it is loooong. looking at the other reviews i think there may be some variation in the length of each individual dress. i am 5\\' 9\" and this dress pooled around my feet (size m). i will be taking it to the tailor to have at least 3-4\" trimmed off the hem, i would recommend erring on the side of the petite sizing or fa I was really excited about this sweater, but the fit was terrible. the sleeves were the right size, but the body of the sweater was a tent - absolutely no shape. they must have clipped the sweater on the model. for reference, i\\'m 5\\'4 and 120 pounds and ordered a size small. The colors are beautiful and the fabric is very soft and comfortable. i will be returning because of issues with length and being low cut.\\r\\n\\r\\nfor reference i am 5\\'5 145lbs, 38-30-40, 34ddd. the dress was low cut and showed too much cleavage for my comfort, but this may not be an issue for women with smaller breasts (or if you don\\'t mind some cleavage showing). this length was also a bit too long, so if you are 5\\'5 or shorter you may want to order the petite size. Ugh, i hate that this didn\\'t work! the top shoulder/sleeve portion is so pretty and unique, but the fabric is overall this and cheap feeling, the length is too short for how flowy the shirt is (the sides go way up on me). the fabric feels like something that would fall apart after one wash. back it goes! Really well made. beautiful. sadly it is very short. not a tunic at all. I ordered this skirt because it looked cute and versatile. when it arrived the pleat in front (shown in the center) was far to the right so the overall look was crooked. not sure if it was a quality control issue or if that\\'s the true design but it will have to go back. too bad because i had high hopes! Beautifully made shirt however the sizing is way off. the sleeves and across the chest are really tight while the rest of the shirt fits fine. if you get a size larger then the shirt in the body is to large. would recommend if you have really tiny shoulders, arms and chest. such a shame since i really love the shirt. I ordered the light pink version in size xl. the details of the top and the shade of pink are pretty. but, the shirt fits me much shorter than on the model. i\\'m not quite 5 ft. 6 inches so it should have worked. the material is thin so i was able to stretch it out to give more length. it does look stretched-out now though. i washed it and it shrank a bit so i stretched it again. this is a top that i kept to wear under vests. the pretty colors and the softness of the material make it worth keepin I tried on the grey version in store, and it was significantly longer than pictured. the back came down to just below my knee, which looked awkward with the split sides. i am 5\\'4\" and this was a regular (not petite) size. however, the overall quality of the fabric was good and it seemed durable. I had really high hopes for this shirt after reading the reviews. first off it runs really small. i usually wear a small or medium ( 4 or 6) i couldn\\'t even get the 6 on. i probably could have even done a 10. the fabric was extremely flimsy. i was almost afraid i was going to rip it taking it off. other than the sizing and the fabric, it just wasn\\'t flattering on me. I was very shocked to receive this dress with a rusty zipper, looks like crusty white rust . see attached pictures. the dress fabric is very nice and i did try it on and it is a very nice fit, lined with a little stretch but my gosh what a cheap poor quality zipper that looks like it was old and exposed to moisture because the metal parts have a white crusty substance! retailer you really need to check your merchandise before sending to your loyal customers. lately the quality has been declining a I was so excited to find this dress in the store! i immediately headed for the dressing room to try this beauty on....what a disappointment. the fabric is stunning, but the fit is extremely voluminous . i am normally a small to medium, so i grabbed a small......the only way to describe this dress is tentlike!  it was huge from the waist down. i don\\'t think i could size to an xs because i am a 34d and the top half of the dress fit perfect!  i was sad to leave the store without this dress. I am loving these new leggings and i dont even surf. i just wear them to the gym and at home and to run errands with a cute tunic top etc... they make me feel sunny and happy :) fabric is light and flexible but stays in place (went running in them) size is accurate, i am usually a 2 on retailer pants/skirts, 27 on jeans, and the small was perfect. I loved the look of this sweater, but the workmanship was surprisingly poor. there were missed stitches, and loose threads throughout, and even a tag sewn to the outside. retailer was great about the return. i really wanted to keep it and was very disappointed. This one didn\\'t work for me. ordered this and the riverdeck tee as similar vein. riverdeck was cute and flattering cut. this one was boxy on me and didn\\'t work. a bit too wide so sending back. I love this dress so much. it is more comfortable than any of my pajamas and the best part is it is very work appropriate, especially paired with chambray shirt buttoned and then tied at the waist. It\\'s the print that attracted me when i was in the store. it is beautiful, but i fear it demands darker skin and hair. if you have problems with yellow, then don\\'t buy. i don\\'t mind the transparency of the fabric because it is not noticeable if you wear a flesh colored cami underneath. because the fabric is light and the shape boxy, it is meant to be flowing, so i purchased my regular size. if you have small breasts you would probably prefer a smaller size. i only wish the blouse had been a litt I couldn\\'t wait to try this dress on when i first saw it featured. it is stunning! i love the red lace over-layed with a blue slip. it adds a fun color contrast to the piece. i am usually a size 6 in retailer clothing and found this one comfortably true to size. this dress has a very renaissance chic quality which is very feminine, flirty and unique. a great find for fall/winter parties. i can\\'t wait to wear it!\\r\\n\\r\\nif i had to find a fault with this dress, it\\'s the lack of pockets. retailer d Quality jumpsuit but poor design. the green made me look a bit like \"gumby the cartoon character\" Such a pretty fall sweater. nice fit. wore it once out shopping and it snagged :( had to return, sadly. When i saw this top online i loved it, and in person i love it even more! so perfect for spring/summer and i can see it even transitioning into fall. the sizing is perfect - i am a size 12/l in tops, and the size 12 i ordered is just right. it\\'s loose but not too loose or frumpy looking. the fabric is slightly thin but that\\'s perfect for the summer, but it would be cute layered with a cami or a cardigan when it\\'s cooler. the only thing is, if you a little busty, the neckline might dip a tiny bit Picked this up in the store today, but didn\\'t try it on first. it is even more gorgeous in person than the photo, but sadly this did not work for me when i got it home to try on. there is wonderful detailing, but somehow the bulky knit fit was just not flattering on. i think it is the thick knit and slightly shorter length. the knit was bulking up in all the wrong places and visually added about 10l bs to my frame. such a shame---really wanted to keep this beautiful sweater but it just did not l I love this dress. it is a fun and flirty summer dress. i think it can be dressed up or worn casually. i am a 36c, 29\" waist, 40\" hips. i bought a size 8 and it fits me great. as others said, it is a little snug across the chest, but i think it is supposed to be. with the proper bra it fits very comfortably! i am going to wear it for mother\\'s day brunch! I loved the layered look without all the bulk. the different textures make it so interesting. I really wanted to love this dress, but i couldn\\'t. it ran large and heavy. rather than a sleek cocktail dress, it felt more like a heavy sack once i put it on. there was one upside: the drape in the back did not appear to drop quite as low, so finding a bra to wear under the dress might be easier than if it draped as low as it appears in the picture. Quality was not what you expect from retailer, especially for the price. top is lined but skirt is not. material is tissue paper thin and see thru. there is a point at the bottom of the sweetheart neckline that does not lay flat, it keeps popping up. however the back is very cute and for that i wanted to love it but too many negatives. was returned. I was so pleased to see this in the store, and i am glad that i had a chance to feel the knit. the combination of wool, cotton, and nylon creates a really soft, luxurious feel to the sweater. i was shocked that it didn\\'t have cashmere in the blend, it is that soft! but, it is equally substantial. this sweater can surely be worn as a piece of outerwear, and it can be used as a layering piece. i consider this one tts because i typically wear a m in a knit that isn\\'t fitted. i disagree with an earl I wanted to love these jeans, but as a woman who is almost 45 there was way too much stretch in them. i am always a size 26 and i couldn\\'t wear these, they were way too tight! they went back the next day. i will say, it could be my body type, i\"m a runner so my legs are muscular. if you have very thin legs, these could be great and work for you. i loved the color, dark blue. This skirt is of the highest quality. the fabric and cut is that of a much higher priced item. the fabric at the seams matches!!! no one mentions any longer when fabric seams are mismatched as if that is nonconsequential. to me it means the difference between good and great. this skirt is great except for the sizing. as other reviewers have mentioned....it runs so small. i wear a size 6 skirt. could not zip the 6. ordered the 8 - it zips yet puckers and while it could work - i\\'d be exhausted fro This top would be great if it were longer and the neck wasn\\'t so open. even for a boatneck, the neck was too wide. for those that don\\'t mind showing their stomachs this top will be okay. the material is nice and stretchy and i like the stripes but just way too short for me. My husband bought this for my birthday. i love that it can be dressed up or worn for a more fun occasion.\\n\\ni\\'m a tad small up top, so it fits a little too loose up there, but other than that it fits great. i\\'m considering getting it altered just because i love it so much. I saw this in my local retailer styled with a tank top underneath and i fell in love and bought the combo right away. it is a vest, so it\\'s not meant to be fitted, so i think sizing down is fine. i\\'m usually an xs/s in tops, i went with the xs in this, and j still get that relaxed look which is nice. this vest is great, very versatile, simple yet adds great style. it was a bit of a splurge for me but i\\'m happy i added it to my closet! These pants are lovely and comfortable, but they are entirely too delicate. i wore them once and nearly any time something touched them, they snagged. i was worried about it when i saw the fabric, and thought i\\'d give it a try, but i didn\\'t think it would be this bad. for the price, i expect better quality. also, they run a little large- unless i pull the waist down low, it gaps in the back and these look better worn a little bit higher, closer to the natural waist. i\\'m usually a 4/6, 28/29 in b I love these jeans! they are really cute and comfy, however, they are way too long. i couldn\\'t believe these were a 33 inch inseam, but i measured them and they are. i am 5\\'4\" and put on a 4 inch heel and they were still dragging on the ground :( these will have to go back as i don\\'t think the same look can be pulled off if they were hemmed. I really wanted to like these. they\\'re soft, long enough for 5\\'8 1/2 and a nice color cut the rise is quite low and the hips puffed out in a weird way. have to return ;( I gained a million pounds in the last couple years so now i usually stay away from anything clingy or stretchy. but this dress is genius. it somehow looks smooth over everything while clinging to the curves in all the right places and none of the wrong ones. i\\'m 5\\'5\", about 190 pounds, and have a proportionate hourglass shape. the m actually fit great. normally i\\'d wear a large but the stretch and flattering cut of the dress made the m look better. i would venture to guess most people could size This socks are very comfortable however they do feel a little big around the top so for people with a small lower calf might find them a bit big. that being said they are very comfortable. I was excited to see this top, ordered it and was disappointed. it was too tight across the chest and had too much fabric around the bottom. i tried this on 3 times hoping for i had been wrong in previous assessments- no luck. This is a cute top but i wore it for around 5 hours and lo and behold i had smurf skin. i did not sweat in it but the color transferred to my underarm area and bra and it did not come off in the shower!! i guess it\\'s going to have to wear off. thank goodness it was not a hot day!! i hope that i can return it. I usually buy xs or s in retailer clothing and the pieces usually fit perfectly. this time i purchased my first petite item because i was worried the length of the pant leg would fall at an unusual spot if i didn\\'t. i\\'m 5\\'4 and i ordered a petite small. i was swimming in it. the elastic in the back was so loose you could see directly down my pants. i wanted to love this but unfortunately the size did not work for me. First saw this poncho on a petite blog and after reading reviews happily paid full price. i followed the petite reviews and purchased the xs regular. the length hits right below my bum so it\\'s perfectly structured to wear with leggings. the cable knit is super soft and very warm. wore this for the first time last weekend layered over a long sleeve tee and was perfectly cozy outside for a fall day in chicago. this item will not last long and is well worth paying full price. I was excited to see this top on sale as i had been watching it for a few weeks. unfortunately, i was very disappointed when i received it. it is, as a previous person said, very much like a pajama top. it is very loose and boxy, and in my opinion, did not flatter my shape at all. sadly, i will be returning it. i would not recommend this top to a person who is athletic, or straight and slender, as you suggest. I got this dress in the mail, and while i loved the concept of it, it really is too boxy. the tie is very superficial and does not really nip you in at the waist, it is more so for show. it is fully lined which was interesting, and to me, made the dress seem boxier. the quality is good, but i am an hourglass and this was completely unflattering. i would have had to size up to make it look like the model shot, but it would have still been a shapeless dress, just bigger. it does fit true to size, Just bought this weekend and had to size down. i\\'m usually a small in jackets and went with the xs. retailer has had this style for the last few years and i\\'ve missed out so finally was able to buy before they sold out!! well worth the price point. i think it will be a very versatile jacket. for sizing reference i\\'m 5\\'7 and 135lbs. This dress does run large, but i\\'m wearing it loose and flowy. bought it for desert trip music festival, with booties and a hat or headband, very hippie chic. my husband thinks it\\'s adorable! the prints are darling. This top fits exactly as it does on the model! it\\'s flattering and comfortable. i wore it to work with dress slacks and got a lot of complements. it\\'s easy to pair with pants or jeans. my only complaint is the material it\\'s made of is a bit rougher and thicker than i thought it would be. but that\\'s minor. i am a petite but this fit me well even though i got it in a regular size. I am in love with this dress and can\\'t wait to wear it to brunch this weekend! i am normally a ps, but they only had the pxs which i took a chance on. fits like a glove. slightly tight in the chest area, but i am chesty for a petite girl. the length is perfect and modest, the detail up front is adorable. I love this dress. i agree with the other reviewers that the rhinestone linkages do very easily get caught on the lace part of the dress and i could see it snagging very quickly. that said, i am going to keep it and hope for the best because it is absolutely gorgeous. it is not actually a true white as it looks pictured. instead we, it is more of a nude color, but it adds to the flattering nature of the dress and makes it look sheer. the embroidery is beautiful. my only complaint is that it will The fit is gorgeous, but i didn\\'t realize it was completely transparent. when it says \"mesh\" it means \"mesh\"! i was thinking the \"mesh\" part was on the bottom. because of how it is cut, high on the shoulders, you can\\'t wear a cami underneath to provide coverage. very cute, but not practical. I love the idea of this top and ordered it in white. it is a great design and proportion is nice with jeans. the front is off white t shirt material with a pocket and the back is a light grey heathered panel. i am returning it as it is very thin and the quality is cheap looking. if the grade of material had been a bit thicker and better made, then it would have been a winner! The design/shape of the dress are quite flattering, flirty and feminine. but.... there is no way that the dress i received is new. the color is a faded washed out red and there are black stains all over the belt area. there is no tag... the fabric looks droopy and laundered and is not crisp, stiff or new. i am very disappointed by the quality of the item that i received. undoubtedly this one is going back.\\n\\ndear retailer - please make sure that you do not send pre-owend clothing articles to Don\\'t be fooled by the image; unless you have a c/d chest, this romper has masses of draped fabric right around your middle--exactly where you want it least! very unflattering and rather expensive for the poor quality. back it goes! This skirt looks/lays exactly like the photo. i bought a size small and i usually wear a size 4. it was maybe a smidge big, but nothing that affected the look of the skirt. the material reminded me of felt/wool mixed together, almost like sunday school felt cut outs (but stiffer) (not a fan).. i was underwhelmed - it looked plain and simple, and the color washed me out. definitely not worth the price (for me anyways). good luck! This shirt is so small. i am not sure who came up with the sizing but you have to go up several sizes to get a comfortable fit. don\\'t waste your time on this shirt. such a shame, it could have been very cute. Love the colors and design of this lace-printed top but didn\\'t realize it\\'s not lined. the description says its polyester lace with polyester lining so i assumed it was lined and when you look at the photos, there is a lining under the top. the arm holes are slightly cut-in both front and back so it will be rather difficult to find a camisole with thin straps with a similar cut so they don\\'t show. other than that, it\\'s a beautiful, unique summer top. I so wanted to love this dress, despite the reviews. when i opened the package i fell in love with the fabric. the print is absolutely beautiful and the fabric feels luxurious. the dress fit perfectly but there was just too much fabric (even though i absolutely loved the fabric). the flowing overlay was just too much. i am returning it. I don\\'t have the right body to pull this off. too many awkward styling issues (length, slits, tie, stitch quality) so this will have to go back. maybe if i was taller and slimmer this would be good. alas, it isn\\'t meant to be... I really loved this dress in the store when i tried it on the color and fabric were perfect for summer but once i got this home i noticed the placket wouldn\\'t lay flat across the bust like shown in pictures. when i went up a size it was too large under the arms so this one will sadly have to go back to the store. The fit is so bad and the construction is very poor. i\\'m 5\\'1\\'\\', 100 lbs, ordered xxs petite. \\r\\n\\r\\nfirst of all, when i button this, there is extreme gaping going on. the vest runs narrow, yet tall?it shifts up my torso if i move at all, making the gaping even worse.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe \"skirt\" at the bottom is made of a very cheap, thin, slightly sheeny material that you would find at a flea market. it arrived unbelievably wrinkled and crumpled, and it was just so thin. it did not meet as closely in the middl I am loving these. they are quite long but are prefect to wear with pj shorts or leggings. very soft and cozy. This is a cute dress, but not for me. 1. i think it runs very small, 2. it is super textured so if you don\\'t want to add bulk (aka pounds) to your frame, this probably isn\\'t for you. it\\'s too bad it\\'s online only because i would have benefitted from trying this on first. i\\'m sure it\\'s probably adorable on smaller, thinner people. unfortunately, mine is going back. I bought this jacket based on how it looked on the model, and from the reviews. i found it to be super big, and unflattering to say the least. i\\'m 5\"10, 155lbs. i sent it back. I ordered this attractive top in my usual size and tried it on with great anticipation. it fit perfectly except across the shoulders, a problem i haven\\'t encountered before. i\\'ve tried it on twice more (do i hope my shoulders will shrink?), only to see that it pulls across the top of the back as before. otherwise, it is so pretty and flattering that i\\'ll be truly sad to send it back. I love sundry and their fun designs--i was disappointed because the fabric is very thin and the dark part of the heart is not black but bluish slate grey. it is just not what i expected from the picture. i bought the xs and it felt baggy on the body. I just tried on this dress in the store, in red, and i loved the off the shoulder design. the color is just as pictured online (a light poppy red). the neckline began a few inches below my collarbone and was super flattering. however, the skirt portion of this dress flared awkwardly at the hips, causing my hips to look much wider than they really are (and also disturbing the otherwise clean lines of the dress). it seemed to me that there was too much fabric at the back portion of the skirt than Like the first reviewer, i love the color and look, and agree that it is much longer and wider than it looks in the photo. i am 5\\'3\" 116lb and ordered a small. i was planning to wear it tucked into palazzo pants as the model seems to have done, but they must have used some other way to gather up the sweater in back because there is no way such volumes of material can be tucked into anything. and the metallic threads are itchy, so i had to finally layer a full sleeve tee under it to be able to st I\\'m 5\\'4\", 130 lbs, curvy and fit. i\\'m usually a size 6 but when i tried these shorts on, they were tight. i sized up to an 8 and they looked better. but overall the fit was not flattering on a petite, curvy frame. i think these shorts would work on someone taller and a bit thinner in the thigh area. Purchased this dress to wear to new orleans in may...perfect with sandals for casual and dinner. so sad that it was not as i had hoped. the fabric is a bit heavy, and the sleeves are very tight (i have thin arms). the color is a bit \"off,\" as the background color is a gray, which doesn\\'t flatter the yellow design. i purchased the large, as this size usually fits me with a bit of flow, but it was very tight all around, especially around the bust area. going to have to return this... It\\'s rare for a dress to completely not work on me, but this dress completely did not work on me. i\\'m tall and have an hourglass figure. i got this dress in my usual size s. this dress somehow made me look ridiculously pear shaped. the empire type bust of the dress made both my bust (32c) and my waist look pretty much non-existent. it looked so bad on me i actually laughed. it\\'s a shame though, because i had been eyeing this dress for a long time. and it is a beautiful dress, but i would not rec Yes it is thin but a great summer blouse. the body runs true to size, but the sleeves are tight..i may try to size up so the sleeves can be more comfortable. I tried this in the black and white in the store. the material is very thin. you cannot wear the white without a cami which defeats the purpose of wearing this tank in the summery. the arm holes are cut very inconsistently. some are very big which creates a very unflattering gap under the armpit. others are cut fine. i tried on 3 different smalls in the black and found one that was cut just right. this does fit snuggly, but is more flattering that way. Finally decided to join the yoga-wear craze and thought these tights and a few other pair from retailer would help me transition to this style. my size l tights were just that -- tight! so tight, i really didn\\'t want to pull them up past the knee!! i am not kidding. i wear size 14 pants and my legs are toned and shapely, so there was no reason to expect a l wouldn\\'t fit. so sad. I think these are a cute pant. they run large in the waist/seat area but not in the length. i\\'m 5\\'4 and this gathered at my ankle. i like them even though i have to keep hoisting them up. keep in mind the tie to tighten the waist does not stay I was a little skeptical about this one at first. i have a hard time with the over all styling of many maxi dresses. i liked the print and figured i would give this a whirl. it is beautiful! looks great on and i love the fabric!! so happy i picked this one up. These culottes are comfortable and cool. i am a size 8-10 and am 5\\' 4\" tall. i ordered the medium. the hemline hits me a little bit longer than the model. also they are more of a bell shape on me rather than kind of a straight pant as shown on the model. the pockets are great! This is my second pair of these because they fit and fell so good. pricey, but worth it. This sweater is great for cold weather. it is very comfortable and soft. only down side is it is a little boxy. I bought this on sale thinking it was a great deal, but when it came in i found it to fit like a totally unflattering sack. the pattern didn\\'t help anything, looking totally faded and washed out...the fabric and overall quality is nice, but the fit and pattern are just so..ugly, unfortunately. had to return it. I really lived the detail , fabric, and quality of this tank. however, the sizing seemed disproportionate. it was tight through the bust and loose the waist. i really loved all the colors i purchased online but had to return them because of the sizing. It\\'s a beautiful top, but not for the price. very thin material (not see-through though), i fear it may easily rip. The photos online make it look like a comfortable, relaxed, lightweight early fall/spring cardigan. when it arrived it looked very wrinkly and there is no \"shimmer\" as far as i can tell. i tried using my steamer to get some of the wrinkles out, but it didn\\'t work. it looks too rumpled and i don\\'t want to wear something that looks like i just rolled out of bed. I saw this online and was pleased they had it in blue at the store. the blue is more of a gray, but it\\'s a great color. i tried on the small and my daughter said \"you look pretty, mommy.\" i was sold! i love the cascade on the side. Light but cozy enveloping sweater. i\\'ve worn this with an evening outfit, as well as to a preschooler\\'s birthday party. it is an odd cut, but now that i have figured it out it is an easy piece to throw on and look put together. tons of compliments every time i wear it. it is quite long (i\\'m 5\\'4\"), so it would work for someone taller, too. Going to alter shoulders straps by shortening for a better fit. petite size would have fit better, but was sold out. I really love this tee! but, the fit can be boxy so i ordered it online in a size 0 and am very happy with how it fits me. i\\'ve worn it with skinny jeans and have gotten complimented repeatedly. This is a great casual skirt for summer, color pairs well with many tops. At first i was interested. i liked the color, the soft tencel fabric, the cut in the back. it was all good. they didn\\'t have my size in the store so i had to order it. when it arrived in the mail it was folded up and wrinkled. i tried it on and it looked like a lifeless unstructured blazer. i sent it back. \\r\\nall in all, it is cute and fun for warm weather. it is definitely a casual blazer. i\\'d probably wait for a sale on this one.\\r\\nit does run tts. Cut out design, no seems or hems.\\r\\n very disappointed in retailer Love the cut and the way they drape. size 26 and 5\\'6\" 135lbs fit great until you wear them for an hour. all of a sudden my 26s became 28s. they were practically falling off. i plan to wash them to see if they shrink. i wish they held their shape since they are so cute. This tops is super cute and great transitional shirt for the fall. a little short in the front but still a great shirt. Ah! i wanted to love this but without anything under it (as pictured), the petite sizing reveals way too much side boob. i am 5\\'3\" and a small b cup. i ordered an xs petite. it fits but there isn\\'t enough material under the armpits. the fabric and design is great other than this flaw. sadly returning. This top arrived today, and after trying it on, i wanted to leave a review to say that the shirt is 100% without a doubt pinned back on the model in the product picture. the fit is designed to be loose, so i don\\'t think anyone could possibly get the same look as the model even if they sized down. i\\'ve included a picture of how it fits naturally, and a picture of how it fits the model as i hold the fabric back. it\\'s still a cute shirt, just not the flattering top i was expecting. i\\'m debating on Remember those cable-knot cotton sweaters that were popular in the eighties?! that\\'s exactly what this sweater is. everywhere your body bends like elbows is emphasized by the fact that cotton does not bounce back like other finer fabrics like wool and cashmere. i\\'ll pass on this! Always looking for sweaters that are wearable in south florida, stumbled upon this gem. from the front gorgeous silvery gray, soft sweater and stunning open back with romantic silky black bow details. bows will hide bra easily underneath. so comfortable, classy and sexy. I\\'m 5\\'4\", 130 lbs, curvy and fit. i\\'m usually a size 6 but when i tried these shorts on, they were tight. i sized up to an 8 and they looked better. but overall the fit was not flattering on a petite, curvy frame. i think these shorts would work on someone taller and a bit thinner in the thigh area. On me this was not good at all. couldn\\'t get it off fast enough. the thick, stretchy fabric instantly added bulk to my frame and the leaf pattern over my mid section emphasized my belly (and i\\'m a size 2). also, the color is a dark, brick red and i think if it had been a true red it would have been much more attractive. Very attractive pattern and color. the black is so soft that it seems close to sepia. the length was fine. the fabric, meaning the dress, is quite heavy for not having a lining except just around the bra area---even though the facing didn\\'t successfully substitute for a bra in my opinion. the arm holes are cut in quite a bit so one would have to find the appropriate bra.\\r\\nthe dress runs very large. i ordered an xs petite. it was about 2 inches too large (4 inches total) on either side across the I bought this shirt to wear to work (i\\'m a teacher). this shirt is so amazing. i\\'m able to pair it with work pants to dress it up, and in denim to dress it down. the cut is incredible, with the peplum waist coming right below my breasts a little above my waist. the length is perfect, and it just seems to create the most perfect shape. the material is high quality, and i just love the fabric texture. it\\'s very soft, and gives a tiny bit of stretch, but not much. i did size up in this shirt (i\\'m u I had been looking at the dresses and jumpsuits from this designer for a while and decided to order this jumpsuit. i\\'m usually an extra small in jumpsuits, and wasn\\'t sure to get the 0petite or 2petite. i\\'m 5\\'3 and about 115 lbs and the 2 petite is perfect in the legs and waist, but a little wide across the chest (i\\'m a 32c). the material is soft and feels very nice and like good quality. it\\'s perfect for dressing up a little in the summer and i\\'m going to think of ways to transition it to the f Cute and very soft, but the elastic wasn\\'t sewn in right. i took them out of the wash and the waistband was a twisted mess. disappointing for more expensive loungewear. So comfortable, fit just right, flattering, beautiful neutral color, but different, love the embroidery, nothing bad about it. that being said, i haven\\'t worn them the whole day, i suspect they will stretch a bit. also have not washed them, so i hope the color stays the nice rich dark gray turquoise, the length is perfect too, i ordered the petite and they fit as on the model (for a change, i have pretty short legs). (115 lbs, 26.5 in waist, muscular legs) I was so excited to get this top in the mail. i loved the colors, print, cut, everything. i put it on and was so disappointed, the top looks so much better on the model. i don\\'t know if i should have gone down a size (i go between an xs and s), but it looked terrible on me! my husband took one look at me in it and said that\\'s being returned. still disappointed This jacket is cozy, warm, and very cute, but after the 1st washing (according to the manufacturer\\'s instructions) it began to pill and has worsened each time. It is soft and hangs great. problem - i wore it one time - and the back balled up terrible. it looked like i had owned it for years - not worn it one time. wouldn\\'t recommend. though it is sooooo soft! The armholes on this dress are totally bizarre. i can\\'t believe no one else has commented on them yet. i am a size s on top and m on the bottom so i usually try on both in dresses. i tend to be a small/ size 6 in retailer. the armholes are so long that the dress doesn\\'t lay right on top. i showed it to on of the clerks in the store and she agreed with me. we looked at all the others and they were the same. going up a size made it way worse. this dress might work for someone with really broad shoul I loved the cut and the stretch in the material made them comfortable, however i found that the material was unflattering for thicker thighs because it tended to cling to the body. it would have been better with some sort of lining as it would have prevented the flimsy material from highlighting imperfections. bottom of pants are not hemmed, so if you want a clean look, you may not like the edges. these were returned immediately as it just did not work for me. I think this top looks lovely; however, it does not fit my body shape. i am an hourglass shape. the shirt clung tightly to my chest and didn\\'t drape nicely around my waist/hips like on the model. i think top could look great on someone who has a lean, square, or athletic build.\\r\\n\\r\\nalso, this top definitely runs large. according to the retailer size chart, i should be between a small and a medium for my waist and hip measurements, but this top was much too large overall in a small and still I really like the look of this jacket, but i think it runs small and i must return the one i received. i am debating about ordering the next size up because it is so cute. it can go with jeans or khakis and bright or white shirt underneath. it seems very versatile. will be a good transition piece between seasons. i also like that it is made in the usa. This shirt style is boxy, however, the material is soft and this shirt is very comfortable. i love the look of the cuffs. this is a fun shirt to wear The fabric is great and the cut is flattering. i have dds, so it pulls a little in the middle. you can just cut from the inside to release the pulling thread. I loved how this jacket looked online and decided to order it. however, sizing can sometimes be tricky for me so i ordered both a petite xs and petite xxs (i\\'m 5\\'1\", 113 lb, and a bra size 32 c). i tired on the xxs first and was swimming in it! so naturally i thought the xs would be even bigger; but to my surprise the xs fit way more snug! in the end, i still didn\\'t like how loose the xs fit so i returned them both. the material is great quality and it\\'s a cute design. i would recommend trying t I\\'m 5\\'2 around 125 lbs, muscular and petite, so i ordered a petite small and it fits great. the length is perfect, i can wear with heels or dress down with flops. it\\'s lined, which i think most dresses and skirts should be, so i was happy about that. i was pleasantly surprised with the slits up both sides, to show a little leg....sexy. it\\'s not too low cut that you have to wear a cami and ruin the neckline, so that\\'s plus. my only issue was the fabric didn\\'t line up on me the same as the model, Love! the perfect go-to black legging! i bought two pair! comfy waist band/not too tight, no muffin top! you won\\'t be disappointed. buy them! This suit was high quality, and a cute design. however, it is clearly made for a lean body type. I should have listened to the previous review on-line before ordering. unfortunately this will go back as the design fit and proportions are simply off. i love uniquely shaped wraps like this, but this one didn\\'t make the cut for me. This dress is horrible. i can\\'t believe they can get away with calling it a \"dress\". it should have been called a tunic or shirt. it looks like it is a soft flowing dress made out of nice material from the pictures, no way. it is made from sweatshirt material it is lifeless and is kind of stiff. it came to the top of my thighs. i can\\'t find one nice thing to say about this dress and i do not recommend it. the picture does it so much more justice that it is worth. I agree with the other reviewer who said there was too much hardware and such. this really does have a lot going on. i usually wear a 4 in skirts, and based on reviews, went up one size. it still saw way up near my chest - i think even an 8 would be too small! it\\'s sooooo tiny at the waist. probably buy 2 sizes, 2 and 3 sizes up from your own. also, the skirt flares super wide at the sides, it doesn\\'t sit the way in the photo or maybe the model is holding it down with her hand. it\\'s like a skirt I bought this online with the intention of it being my graduation dress. i\\'m 5\\'2\", 115 pounds so i should\\'ve known better and gotten a \"petite\" style dress. however, i loved the modern look of this and since my boobs are a bit bigger (34d) i figured they would help fill it out. upon receiving the dress, i was first shocked that for the price, the construction was pretty poor quality: there were strings coming out of the straps and they looked unevenly sewn. when i put it on, it was clear that th Was super excited to try this on, but had to go up 3 sizes from my normal 6 and the waist was still too tight - i was swimming in the top as well. just a very strange cut and unflattering. such a bummer because it\\'s so pretty. I just bought this dress on the half off sale price which is practically a steal and i must say i absolutely adore it! it runs pretty tts but all they had available was one size up from my usual 6 so i bought the 8 and it fits just fine (34d-27-35). the color is beautiful and the look of the dress is very vintage 30\\'s/40\\'s and so cute. i didn\\'t find the sleeves to stick out at all on me so maybe i just got lucky and the print is just adorable on this. i highly recommend! I ordered a size 4, my usual size is a 4 or 6. the tunic fit well through the torso, but the arm length was too short and hit just below the elbow. the sleeve interfered with arm bending and moving. i have petite proportions so the arm length of regular size garments is usually too long. i don\\'t want to go up in size because the body of the tunic might be too roomy. I love every other byron lars dress i\\'ve bought and this was a no brainer for me. when it arrived i was really disappointed. the fabric is very stretchy which makes it super forgiving and very thick. with all the buttons planted on this dress i was expecting it to open easily from the front as one of my other dresses by his does. nope. only the back buttons open. thick stretchy fabric and back buttons...not an easy thing to navigate. i was also very sad to see that the length was all wrong for m Soft fabric. great color for fall and sophisticated detail at waist, sleeves. a keeper! The melon color is soft and flattering. it is a little on the long side in the back, but i paired it with a lightweight, flowy sweater, and received compliments. This top is full of amazing details. the photos really don\\'t do it justice. it is very flowy and does run large but is so pretty and soft and in beautiful shades of blue. i bought a small and it is fairly long in back on my 5\\'5\" frame but because of the detailing...it just works. The fit is gorgeous, but i didn\\'t realize it was completely transparent. when it says \"mesh\" it means \"mesh\"! i was thinking the \"mesh\" part was on the bottom. because of how it is cut, high on the shoulders, you can\\'t wear a cami underneath to provide coverage. very cute, but not practical. Cozy slouchy sweater. very versatile. fits tts, just as shown on model. Very comfortable to sleep in. doesn\\'t bunch up or twist. love this. I didn\\'t realize that the grey sleeves are attached (i assumed that was just an undershirt on the model). needless to say it looks cheap and poorly made. will be returning I was very excited to receive this dress because of the cute photo. however, upon arrival i was completely disappointed. the color is much more drab than the photo. the smudged polkadots weren\\'t attractive. there were many little bumps and pulls in the linen. the dress is super heavy. the pleats around the waist did not lay correctly.\\nand it adds 10 pounds to your hips! super sad! i am sending it back. Given that i am petite with thighs (take a size 6p or 28p) these were not for me! the run small, are really tight from the thigh up, run longer that a petite should and are fairly thin. on top of that the zipper and hook in the back are really inconvenient. i was looking for something i could wear to work, and these were not the right style for that. plus they seemed cheaply made, like they wouldn\\'t stand the test of time. i imagine if you are tall and skinny like the model, they would look good I love coats and have a collection of unique ones and this one is in my top 3! wow is it a stunner! totally different and very classy. not my every day coat but will be used for dinner outings and special occasions with the right outfit. i did reinforce the buttons since there had been many complaints about that, which is why i only gave it 4 stars for quality. great design on this one retailer! Unless you have the body of the model - tall and very thin and wear a really small size - don\\'t even think about getting this dress! it\\'s literally a heavy sack. it hit right above my knee in the front and basically mid-calf in the back. the material is nice but it\\'s an awful shape! The dress didn\\'t meet my expectations, specifically the color, the texture, and the cut of the dress. although the dress was very well made, it just wasn\\'t right for me. I love these pants. bought them in both black and burgundy. but the burgundy pair split in the butt before i even made it to work in the morning. they weren\\'t even tight. so disappointing. i will be returning them. This blazer looks great on the model and i have a long torso so i thought it would be perfect. when i got it it looked like a big box and didn\\'t fit anywhere. the shoulder pads were giant and the bottom of the coat was huge. i got a small based on other reviews, but it was way too big. sadly, i had to return it. I am so surprised this was not styled properly in the photo! if worn the way it should be worn it would have sold out before going on sale. yes it is open down each side but you need to slide a belt inside the back so the back is left full and bring the belt out into the front on sides cinching in the front...making this a dramaticly gorgeous piece! i love it and will wear it with my leather jeans to pencil skirt. i am a personal stylist and designer and if you are thinking about this piece jump I had my eye on this jacket (in moss) for awhile. i was afraid the vegan leather wouldn\\'t feel natural or soft but i was wrong. it\\'s wonderfully soft - so much so that every time i wear it and tell someone it\\'s vegan leather, they feel compelled to touch it and can\\'t get over the quality. the detailing is great and the back adds a special, interesting touch. it\\'s become my go-to jacket and works just as well with jeans as it does with a nice dress. and who doesn\\'t love getting a compliment every I saw this dress in the store in the coral color and tried it on. i am 5\\'4\", 34b, and slender to athletic build. i wear the size 2 in this dress. as far as sizes go for retailer, i would say it is tts. the slip fits like it should and the dress is flowing. it is not see through as were some of the other silk dresses this summer. it feels so comfortable and makes me feel pretty. it is a flowing dress and meant to fit that way. i waited for it to go on sale and the day it did i purchased it!!! Cute and very soft, but the elastic wasn\\'t sewn in right. i took them out of the wash and the waistband was a twisted mess. disappointing for more expensive loungewear. I loved the dress, but just not dressy enough after rethinking what i needed. very easy order and return. thanks! The shirt is great, aside from the fact that it runs very large. i ordered an xs when i usually wear a s and it is still very big on me. the color is great though, and the fabric is more comfortable than i expected. i still wear it occasionally with pants or skirts that i can easily tuck it in to. I have loved the pilcrow hyphen chinos, and have purchased many pairs. however, the last 3 pairs i\\'ve ordered are all a different cut now. they are no longer the chino i loved, although they have the exact same name. they are now \"boy cut\", and are much more narrow through the hips and thighs. nowhere on the description does it say \"boy cut\". it\\'s not until the package arrives in the mail that i\\'m saddened to find this changed product with the same number. it really should say this int he descri I think this top looks lovely; however, it does not fit my body shape. i am an hourglass shape. the shirt clung tightly to my chest and didn\\'t drape nicely around my waist/hips like on the model. i think top could look great on someone who has a lean, square, or athletic build.\\r\\n\\r\\nalso, this top definitely runs large. according to the retailer size chart, i should be between a small and a medium for my waist and hip measurements, but this top was much too large overall in a small and still I was so looking forward to receiving this in the mail! when it arrived, i was very disappointed. the color is more mauve than dusty pink, and the fabric is stiff and wrinkled.....not at all what i expect velvet to be (flowy and soft). the fabric seems very cheap for the price point.  i usually like floreat, but this one is headed right back to the store! Tried small and medium and both were quite tight on the bottom. top is perfect. will return the bottoms and try the large. I got the navy stripe version of this shirt and it has a very cute nautical vibe to it. i am either an xs or s in antho, and went with the xs for this shirt as i think the s would be too boxy. normally i would have overlooked this shirt as it\\'s rather unimpressive on the hanger, but it was on sale so i tried it on. very cute when tried on! it fits well across the shoulders but isn\\'t too clingy in the body, which i like. the fabric is very comfortable and the shoulder detail gives it a little mor I really wanted to love this but the cut was very wide, short, and crooked. after it was washed once, it was completely unwearable because it hung all wrong. This is such a cute summer tank to wear with capris or shorts. it is loose fitting and while i normally prefer the petite sizing at 5\\'1, i got the 00 since i liked the longer length. i purchased the wine and navy colors and the neckline isn\\'t too deep at all. love it! I found this dress to be shapeless on (even when the belt was tied). i love the tshirt material and the fact it has short sleeves. it\\'s just too boxy. I\\'m an hourglass shape and on me this dress didn\\'t give me any shape at all. and i felt the bell sleeves were a little much. the lining though is really soft and excellent for colder weather. and the print is very pretty, just as pictured. Saw online and had to have. got it home and i was swimming in it! i normally am a size l in most retailer brands, but this felt so large! the actual top is lovely, with an airy artistic quality to it. not sure if i will go back for the medium or not. Like the previous review said, i was excited to receive this top. i had grand visions of all the ways i could wear it! to my chagrin, when i put it on, it just fell right down and pooled around my waist. i wish there were smaller sizes to order. sadly, this is going back. This sweater is extremely roomy. the cut is very wide - wider than it is long, the sleeves are dolman style, and the neck is a little loose. with a lot of manipulation i managed to convince myself that i wasn\\'t wearing a tent, but i would suggest sizing down and also being tall and thin, if you can. i\\'m keeping mine despite a funky fit on my hourglass frame because i\\'m exploring funky town lately. join me at your own risk! I am somewhere between a 24 and a 25 (i have narrow hips but an average waist), so i was happy to find that these worked for me in me in a 0. i loved the blue color as an interesting neutral. they did stretch out a little with wear, but i still felt like i looked good by the end of the day. i typically really like cotton/linen blends as i can usually wear them out of the dryer if i\\'m going for a casual look - a few wrinkles with linen doesn\\'t bother me. but these. oh my. when i pulled them out o This is really cute but does run large, if your in between sizes size down. the fabric at the front is super bulky but with a smaller size could be ok? it is so itchy, imo uncomfotably so! i would have returned for a smaller size had it not been so uncomfortable, ugh why! i loved the sleeves, very cute bell. and the back hung nicely. they need to make this in a cotton, vocoder and no wool! loved bit couldnt bear it. Couldn\\'t wait for this sweater to arrive. i love oversized sweaters for the fall! unfortunately this sweater is extremely itchy that it has to be returned :( Love tiny. i am 5\\'7\", 125-128 lbs depending on the day, and a 34a. i also have a very long torso, and tiny shirts are one of the few brands that are usually long enough for me. this one, however, was a huge miss. i ordered online in my usual tiny xs. it was much too big around and felt shorter in the front than stated, so it looked boxy on me. however, the worst part was the placket. the description doesn\\'t note that it\\'s held together with a tiny snap. that snap takes nothing to undo, and then I ordered not one but two sizes of this dress to try on and was hoping to ultimately wear to an event - one 00 petite, one 00. the style, color and cut are all perfect. one not so minor downfall, however. the zippers on both dresses were faulty - they both broke in the same spot, both during the first time just trying them on. i can\\'t get either of them to even budge now - will either need to take back or get fixed. very sad about this. What a shame this dress is. i wear xl and am 5\\'2\", but the dress in the store in the size xs(!!!!!) looked just the right size. yup! xs was just the right size. i can\\'t imagine anyone who wears m or s finding this dress fit flattering. it would look like a sack. it is an inch or two too short in the front for me, so i\\'ll be returning it. I love the color (mustard) and design of this shirt! however, the description says it\\'s made of cotton and i was disappointed to find when it arrived that it\\'s actually made of 100% modal ? which is a big difference to me. i also think it runs small ? i ordered a medium (5\\'5\", 125#, 34c), but would have had to order a large if i wanted the look pictured on the model. finally, the modal fabric is quite thin and i don\\'t imagine it\\'ll last too long without tearing. i\\'ll probably keep it because i l The skirt is comfortable and as pictured. it also ran tts. i\\'m 5\\'5\" tall and weigh 140 lbs. i had the medium and didn\\'t need to size up to a large. when you put the skirt on a normal body, it looks like you are wearing an easter egg... and not in a good way. I absolutely loved this top. it fit great and was easy to dress up or down. i wore it once and washed it according to the tag. cold water and flat dry. it is now 4 sizes too small and unwearable. extremely disgusted. I ordered this tee despite the price. the fabric is very thin and the quality was poor. nice concept for a tee, but failed in quality and value. it was returned. Ordered this top online, as i loved the colors and design, but i should have listened to the other reviewers. i ordered my usual size m, and it was just very unflattering. it was short and wide, not at all like it\\'s pictured on the model. needless to say it was immediately shipped back. I was really excited about this skirt because i love the color. however when i tried it on, it was too much of a high/low. i am not very tall but this would look a lot better on a tall person. It\\'s a lovely pattern on a soft tee. the fit is similar to how it looks on the model, not clingy at all. it should be noted that it\\'s fairly see-through. if i wear a bra that\\'s close to skin color it\\'s not an issue, but it is obvious if you\\'re wearing any kind of patterned or contrasting bra. i suppose you could wear a cami underneath, but it\\'s too hot for that in florida and i think it defeats the purpose of a t-shirt. overall, i\\'m very happy with this, though i\\'m also very very happy i got thi I\\'m a short girl, but i usually wear tops in a small or medium at retailer. for me, i would have needed this shirt in a size at least one notch smaller than even offered. this shirt is adorable. love the details. i wanted it so bad, which is why i paid so much for a basic t-shirt. still, it was large to the point of frumpiness and could have used some sort of scoop or v-neck to break up the dots. I love this top! i purchased the gray simply because i felt it would go with more. i can pair it with blue jeans, my pink pilcro chinos, and even my turquoise pilcro shorts. i love that this tee doesn\\'t have the rolled sleeves, so it\\'s a little more finished looking. i tried on both the small and medium and both fit, but i preferred the tapered fit of the small and ultimately went with that. for reference, i\\'m 5\\'8\", 140 lbs, 32d chest. i do think $58 is hefty for a t-shirt, so you could roll the Love the color and overall design of this dress...but it\\'s just going to have to go back. the view from the direct front and back are nice, but froth side the high waist and secure back make me look pregnant. not the look i\\'m going for especially at this price.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe other oddity is that the white circle design is unfortunately placed! in the back it\\'s all i see which is \\'right\\' on a bulls-eye and the same on the front. i don\\'t know how the designer missed this! it\\'s the only white design on th I got this in black. it can be casual or dressy. very lightweight, comfortable and flattering. i \"collect\" black tops (since i rarely wear any other color) and this is now one of my favorites. i think it looks totally different in the black than it does in the other colors -- more refined, less casual. this runs quite large. i am a 0-2 but needed the 00 in this top. This tops is super cute and great transitional shirt for the fall. a little short in the front but still a great shirt. I\\'m so incredibly disappointed. the dress is beautiful but the one i received is torn and has multiple strands of beads missing. poor quality control. I\\'m 5\\'2\", weigh 120 lb.. i ordered p6 and found the torso too short. if i bent forward or kneeled down that fabric would ride ride up into my butt big time. the top was a little loose too. i\\'m 35ab cup. i love the colors and geometric design. sadly i have to return. I tried this dress on and convinced myself that i didn\\'t need it. on another visit, i tried again and couldn\\'t resist. it is amazingly comfortable and a great alternative to shorts/jeans/pants. you can dress it up a bit with sandals vs athletic shoes but the fabric does tend toward more festive picnic or outdoor concert vs wedding. i prefer wearing dresses so this is a wonderful addition. I was really excited when i ordered this dress for na upcoming beach vacation but was very disappointed when i finally saw it in person. it reminded me of those christmas nightgowns from the 90s with the red and white ruffles. pass! I\\'m so disappointed this dress didn\\'t work out! i ordered the size medium, post baby i\\'m a solid dress size 6 or 8 depending on the designer.\\r\\nthe cashier was laughing with me how ridiculously huge this garment was when i held it up. \\r\\n\\r\\nalso the length was super long, description says 35\" which would be mid thigh for me, but this thing hit me mid knee. also, like the previous review the shoulders are tented and poofy. so bizarre and the cut reminds me of a maternity dress, but the shoulders def This was my absolute favorite top before it transferred dye onto the driver\\'s seat in my car. >:-( there is nothing in the language of the care tag which advises to wash before wearing because of the possibility of dye transfer to other surfaces. the care instructions say that is is washable with like colors and, in fact, recommends dry cleaning. really? and dry cleaning will remove all of that excess dye? don\\'t think so. after i discovered the dye transfer on my car seat, i washed the top in a The blue is a beautiful color, rather unique and it is really soft being cashmere. although, for the price i do feel it should of been a bit more \"special\". i also feel it\\'s loose lower half feels a bit maternity. all that being said i do like the overall sweater and am keeping it as the color and feel win. This jacket has cute details. i like the front pockets and color. it has no shape and is about 1 size bigger than marked. i felt like a sack of potatoes in it. First, thanks retailer for not putting itchy wool or fur in this! it\\'s so soft! gorgeous bias for is super flattering for those of us with less than perfect bodies. for reference, i\\'m 5\\'5\", 32dd, 28, 38. size xs/s was perfect. If i stopped eating for a couple of months or jumped into a time machine and set the dial for 1990 i would really enjoy this beautifully made delicate blouse. the problem area is evident looking at the photo --the tiny tight fitted gorgeous bodice. i will keep this piece becasue i love it so and the apocolypse is apparently imminent and i have hardly any food in the house. My local store offered this dress in a navy colorway with sky blue and pink embroidery. tried it on and fell in love! it fits well while being comfortable. my favorite part is the skirt - perfect flirty a-line. already bought matching cardigans and can\\'t wait to wear this to work. so perfect for spring! The fit on these is amazing and the color is great too! sometimes the fading is too much on jeans but this is just right. the rise fits really well and the length is great! love pilcro! I was so excited to get this dress. i saw someone try it on in the store and waited all season for it to go on sale. i loved it except for the seam that was right at the neckline in the front. they didn\\'t even try to match up the fabrics. it was so obvious and cheap looking that i had to send this dress back. so sad! Very cute. i received many compliments when i wore it. fits true to size (petite 2) with some good stretch in it. i am 5\\'3 and it was slightly longer than that on the model. it is a little odd that the buttons are all not the same. but perhaps that is part of its charm and it is not noticeable. it is very comfortable and the pictures are representative of what it looks like. This runs huge, not large, huge; and hung in quite a baggy way. bought a medium ( 5\\'10, 150 lbs) and i could have gotten an x-tra small. maybe if there were free shipping i would have reordered, but now its just too much of a hassle This beauty arrived in my store today...and despite all my gals telling me that i own too many vests, i just had to have this one. i\\'ve always wanted a cozy fur or sherpa vest...but i\\'m curvy and always feel like those add bulk. this one only has sherpa on one side (the softest most cozy sherpa ever) and its not too bulky! the print is even better than it appears online...in fact, the vest almost appears pink online, and its not in person. there is much more variation in color in person! i adore I returned this dress because the material is so flimsy and thin. i was expecting higher quality, especially for the price. i was disappointed. it is a pretty dress and fit great, but i felt like i was wearing tissue paper. Love these pants i bought them in two colors! flattering fitting!! im 5\\'4 120lbs 36\" hip. i bought these in size 25. sometimes i don\\'t like petit sizing but these petite at 30\" long inseam still gave me enough length to wear with heals. there is the usual good and bad with linen - after you wear them once you need to iron because they look too wrinkled and worn. the linen is light and washed - unfortunately i don\\'t think these pants will hold up for more than a two years. i\\'ll love them while i These are just perfect, exactly as pictured if not nicer. very soft and comfy with a big sweater on for winter months. Love it!! it does run big so i had to return for smaller size. fabric is nice very true to picture This shirt is a great deal on sale,i would not pay full price.i got it in the honey color and it is really cute. this shirt does run very large. i normally wear a small or size 4 to 6 and i was lost in a size 6. i went with a size 2 and it was perfect for sizing purposes i am a 34c and 5\\'3\" 112lbs..shirt is a bit lightweight so it is nice for summer or year round. I love this dress! my goal is to have a closet full of clothes that are really cute and stylish, but are also very comfortable... this dress fit the bill. the mixture of the fabrics is even more cute in person than it looks online, and the fabric is so soft, it almost feel like wearing pajamas. the weight of the fabric also makes it hang really nicely, and so it\\'s flattering. overall, a great addition to my spring/summer wardrobe. I was debating getting a large in this top but went for the medium, boy is it huge, the jersey fabric is quite thick which makes the sleeves bulky and uncomfortable, even the small would be giant! \\r\\nfor reference i normally wear a size 8/10 my chest is 34 e and this was just so so huge, it hung so badly of my chest that it looked frumpy and made me look bigger than i am.\\r\\nthe colours are true and nice and vibrant... definitely size down with this one I was excited when i saw these shorts in my local retailer store. i wear a 25 sometimes 26 and i grabbed an xs. however, when i tried these shorts on i was sad to see that they run big and looked baggy on me. they fit, but are really loose. i am probably going to have to return these because they don\\'t come in an xxs. they are great shorts and a perfect length, but make sure you size down. I read the cleaning instructions label carefully. followed them closely. and still, the dye ran and stained some of my colored clothes. pi**ed me off! just after the first wash and even before wearing them, i have streaks of uneven color on the pants. bad quality material or dye is what causes this. now i have to go and see if i can even get out my other stained clothes. thanks a lot retailer. This is a beautiful dress except i expected it to be more flowy. the fabric is much more stuff than i thought it would be. It broke my heart to return this shirt. the pattern is just the kind of quirky that i crave from retailer. the quality is really great but in the end this shirt was just way to big. i don\\'t think the xs would have made enough of a difference. sad face. This is a beautiful tunic. the colors are vibrant and the stitching is high quality. please note that the insets on the sides are not actual stitching but a print. it is still very pretty. please size down a size. i am usually a large, wearing a 12 or 14 if something runs tight across the bust, i ordered a large and it is a bit big under the arms but too big through the waist area. i am not small in this area either.i would recommend buying this tunic. So this may be my least favorite thing i have ever bought from retailer. this top had so much extra material it was like wearing a bag or parachute. it looked a million times cuter in the photos. I ordered a size 12 and it was huge on me! very loose fitting dress. i didn\\'t like the material either. I was really excited about this sweater, but the fit was terrible. the sleeves were the right size, but the body of the sweater was a tent - absolutely no shape. they must have clipped the sweater on the model. for reference, i\\'m 5\\'4 and 120 pounds and ordered a size small. Very disappointed. ordered two sizes, the fraying of the embroidery was so bad on one of the dresses i wouldn\\'t have worn it and the zipper was sticking. the second dress had fraying and loose threads as well and the seams at the shoulders were not properly sewn which made the lace at the neckline completely crooked. some of these issues would maybe be acceptable if the dress was under $100 but at $228 they are not. returning both sizes. Top is completely see through. i cant imagine if it were to get wet what it would look like. it is a cute design but not practical at all. I wore this dress to a baby shower. it fit nicely and i received many compliments. i liked the weight, it flowed while walking and it was quite sweet. I was surprised retailer decided to ship this sweater. the sweater looks like it\\'s falling apart and it is huge. i would not recommend this even at a clearance price. I have a few evening functions this month and the next few months and i thought this dress would be different and fun. i really wanted to like it, but i could not. there were spots missing sequence, some fell off as i tried the dress on, and i did try it on twice. each time there were some on the floor. they are sewed on so poorly, for the price of this dress. i fear it would be a dress for one season and i\\'d have to throw it out. not for that price. so back it goes. The cowl and cuffs of the dress are thick and heavy sweater material, but the dress itself is extremely thin. the non-belted pictures do not show how much volume there is to the dress, which was enormous in my normal size. I\\'m 5\\'7\" 155lbs and ordered a large. it fit, but the arms were awkwardly short. the finish details on the end of each sleeve almost would have to be pushed back to the elbow for it to look right, which would be okay. however, the interior seam of the neckline is cut jaggedly and isn\\'t even finished with any stitching. it\\'s just tucked haphazardly inside the neckline and isn\\'t sewn--it would unravel with washing. \\r\\n\\r\\nit\\'s soft and snuggly and cute if you get it on super-sale and don\\'t mind it com Love, love these jeans. being short they come right to my ankle. super soft and don?t require any hemming. i ordered my typical jean size of 26 and they fit like a glove. would love to have these in black and grey. I loved the look of this sweater, but the workmanship was surprisingly poor. there were missed stitches, and loose threads throughout, and even a tag sewn to the outside. retailer was great about the return. i really wanted to keep it and was very disappointed. Lightweight, airy silk. it\\'s not shown in the photos but it has a half slip which is too noticeable through the thin silk. it looks somewhat cheap. the silk doesn\\'t feel smooth to the touch. it has a slight roughness to it. it would have been nicer if they had used thicker, higher quality silk. the waist has a tight, wide, elastic band which after wearing for awhile feels uncomfortable. the color of the skirt is true to the photos. i wanted to love this skirt but i will be returning it. The sweater is very comfy and looked good the first time i tried it on, however the material is thin and slightly see through.\\nalso, after one wear it completely stretched out and made the long sleeves awkward to wear without washing in between each wear. after the third time i wore it, i discovered a large hole in the armpit, most likely due to the excessive washing. i would not recommend this sweater. I noticed the reddish one (actually, barney-purple) in my local store and had to try it one, since i like this cut of dresses from my teenage years. the color was my main concern, but this proved perfect overall. it is low cut in the bust, but a scarf can fix it for us modest girls. there were quite a few loose threads on the lace and stiching that i had to trim off. for the reference, i am 5\\'4\", 120 lbs, and an xs was perfect. This top is too boxy and has too much going on. it should have no buttons or different ones. Love this blouse. it has great coverage but is very light (yes it is a bit sheer, but with a nude bra you can\\'t tell at all), so it\\'s great for needing to look professional on hot summer days. the structure at the bust/waist creates a very flattering shape, and i love the bronze gold buttons with the black pattern. i got a 2 (usually a 0 but every once in a while i need to size up) and could\\'ve possibly gone with a 0, but am happy with the freedom of movement i have with the arms with the 2. ove Recently received this and was very disappointed with the quality. the fabric was very thin, easily stretched out of shape. price is ridiculous for this item! I bought this shirt specifically for the extra details on the shoulder. when i received the shirt, it was a little stiffer than i expected but not enough to return it for being too uncomfortable. I fell in love with the print, it is much prettier in real life. more teal burgundy on yellow and more vivid than it shows here. the waist elastic is too tight and high for me....would prefer it looser and not on natural waist. but i still bought it and am ordering a second one in hopes that the elastic tightness is varied. This is a pretty everyday piece to add to your wardrobe. the color is a little less pink and more peach than depicted in the photo and the top is just a bit on the short side but i was afraid that if i sized up, it wouldn\\'t give me more length but maybe look boxy instead. i\\'m 5\\'7\", 140lbs, 32dd with an athletic build and ordered the small. Really well made. beautiful. sadly it is very short. not a tunic at all. I really love the pattern and the look on the model, and i thought i would love it. i ordered online, so i did not try on in store. when i tried it on, it has way too much fabric around the waist and skirt. it is thick fabric as well, and has a lining, and the waist has extra fabric for the design, and it has pockets, so it all adds up to be way too bulky. it is not flattering at all and made me look 10 pounds heavier. i am returning this dress. sad, because it looks so lovely on the model. i am I ordered both colors in different sizes (xs and xxs) - petite were no longer available, so can\\'t compare there.\\r\\n\\r\\ncolor: i liked the black better for these reasons:\\r\\n1) color can be worn year-round, just add a nice jacket or cardigan, and ok for winter season.\\r\\n2) ivory was kind of see-through\\r\\n\\r\\nsize: xxs fit me better, the xs was wider and bigger arm holes.\\r\\n\\r\\nsadly, the xxs was the ivory, so i didn\\'t keep either of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nref: 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in wasit I\\'m a petite so as usual i have to order from retailer. i saw this on line and tried it on in a regular size in the store. even though of course it didnt fit, the style of the tee was nice so i ordered it. i couldnt have been more disappointed when i received it. the quality was truly awful. i\\'m not even sure why it is being sold. the neckline was warped and wouldn\\'t lie flat again the neck or chest; the bottom hem was crooked. it was really bad. also having purchased tees in similar material befo I ordered the blue stripe and white in size large. i didn\\'t like it worn off shoulder but it does stay in place, which is a good thing. and it looks okay worn on the shoulders. i find the fabric so uncomfortable and itchy that i couldn\\'t wait to take it off, immediately. i tried them on again a second time, still hopeful, with the same outcome. sadly, returning. Super cute skirt. i decided to return it because i felt like i did\\'t have enough tops to go with it. I\\'m 5 ft 7 125 lbs true size 4 and these pants made me look like i had boy parts. super disappointed! I know this is supposed to look oversized, and i own a few oversized ponchos, but this takes oversized to a whole new level.  i ordered it in my usual size and it was just waaaaay too much fabric - i do not think sizing down would have made a difference.  if you are looking for that, it seemed like good qualify. The pattern is very adorable. unfortunately the design is flawed. sizing is great at the waist and hip, and the length is spot on, but the top is wide. it\\'s strange because i don\\'t think it would fit someone that was bustier than me either.\\r\\nwill return. i\\'m considering buying again on sale and having a tailor correct it. I ordered this top on line. i wanted to love it, but unfortunately the fit was not for me. i am 5\\'9 with a long torso. this top was cut very wide and looks like a maternity top. Adorable top, but i have to agree with what two other reviewers said... that is is boxy and unflattering. i have a similar patterned top, also by maeve, but the sizing on that runs small, medium, large. the s petite that i have doesn\\'t fit quite the same as the 4 petite in this blouse. this is definitely more \"square\" in the torso, and the ruffles do stick out more - very flouncy. it just made me look frumpy instead of the sexy date night look i was going for. i am 5\\' and 120 lbs. also, i didn\\'t I love the unique design of this dress.  it also has a nice thick material.  the top part runs small.  i\\'m normally between size 6 and 8.  i bought this dress in size 10 and the top part is still snug, whilst size 12 is too loose.  the bottom part has a nice flowy material with pockets.  since the top part is snug, it will best not to wear a bra plus the thick material will provide a nice support.  the down side of this dress is that the straps are running long.  i have a short torso, so there\\'s I really like this top. i am usually a medium in retailer clothing and so i ordered this in medium. it did not fit right across my chest, the empire part cut right across my breast and not underneath like it is supposed to. i returned the top for a large and it fits just right in that area. other than that this top is light and airy, flowy and pretty. i love it! After the reviews about sizing, i ordered the size 16 (am normally size large). interestingly, the tag on the blouse says it\\'s a 14. with all that said, the blouse is cute enough and sizing up gave me enough length (in spite of the higher sides) that i\\'m considering keeping it. although it\\'s a bit big, it flows nicely and isn\\'t oversized in that wide, crazy way. the sleeves are a bit too big but they\\'re cuffed with a button and can be rolled. the fabric is somewhat crinkled in texture. i got the This sweater is very pretty. i had my concerns being that i don\\'t normally pay $300.00 for a sweater but i found the material to be extremely high quality and the details really make it a beautiful piece. i literally got a little tired of people telling me all day how pretty it was. this is definitely a piece of clothing i will cherish for years to come. The pattern of this skirt is adorable and looks better in person but the fabric isnt the best. it feels like an elastic fabric and is way to volumous. overall not my favorite. Love this top--the material is very soft and though this isn\\'t a thick tshirt, it holds its shape and supports the grommet detailing nicely. i\\'m 5\\'7\", about 130, not busty, and got a small--fits great! the color is more of an off-rose/blush (has more of a brown tint than the photo shows). I thought this dress looked so cute and comfortable and was excited to try it on, and i was majorly disappointed. it was incredibly unflattering, in every way. as a few of the other reviewers mentioned, if you have any sort of bust the dress will not hang nicely, the waist band was too high up and made me look pregnant. i\\'m 5\\'2 and curvy and usually take a lg in retailer, but this...ewww! i will say the color and material are gorgeous, but i\\'m guessing this is the type of dress that would look bes I needed to write a review only because i feel like the dress is getting a bad rap by other reviewers. it is a loose, flowy, swing dress. i typically wear structured fit and flare dresses, but i do love a feminine, loose, casual dress from time to time too. this totally fit the bill. it is true to size, fitted on the arms, loose and swingy everywhere else. i got the peach color and love it. the cotton slip underneath is very comfortable too. i ordered the sp and it hits just above my knees in th Dress runs small esp where the zipper area runs. i ordered the sp which typically fits me and it was very tight! the material on the top looks and feels very cheap that even just pulling on it will cause it to rip the fabric. pretty disappointed as it was going to be my christmas dress this year! needless to say it will be going back. When i first saw this shirt online i was so excited! it reminded me of why i love shopping in the fall! unfortunately when it came i was so disappointed. in person the fabric and the colors are gorgeous. it\\'s fairly lightweight for a flannel but so soft and comfy cozy. i love the navy/cream polka dot that is on the inside of the cuffs and collar as well, and the buttons are cute too! when i put it on it was so comfortable, but it made me look like i was pregnant! especially from the side it just Purchased this in-store today. i\\'m normally a small, but tried on x-small before trying on my regular size. the x-small fit perfectly. i\\'m 5\"5, 135 lbs, with wide hips and petite derriã¨re. the dress fit well, slightly hugging my bottom. while i don\\'t like things that draw attention to my bottom, with an outward tug or two of the stretchy material of the dress, it fit perfectly. sweater dresses tend to be bulky, so it makes sense to down size. definitely a nice addition to my closet. The fabric and its texture didn\\'t meet my expectations unfortunately. there were too much fray and cast-off of edge yarns of a fabric... \\r\\nhowever this will fit if you wear over the swimming wears. Loved this dress when i tried it on in the store and thought it would be perfect for a casual wedding. unfortunately, the day of the wedding the zipper split and i had to wear something else. it fit well, but was poorly made. based off other reviews, this isn\\'t the first time this has happened with this dress! not worth the risk at all. I wish this came in a petite size! i\\'m going to do my best to add some stitches in the ruching to keep the middle taught. i\\'m busty (32 ddd) and the suit had plenty of coverage and lift. i will need to make additional loops in the back latch but this piece is worth all the extra work. i was surprised this worked so well for a short curvy figure. i ordered a medium. This dress is adorable. it simply did not fi off the rack.\\r\\ni invested 15 dollars in alterations to get rid of the very bottom side pockets- why where they even there? and to shape the bottom. basically the dress is straight all the way down the sides.by up and alter....\\r\\nthe top pattern and cut at the top made the alteration investment worth it to me- the quality of the fabric is excellent.\\r\\nand the pattern is adorable- can be worn as little black dress, cocktail party or date night. the top de Love this sweater! great for work. very soft and comfortable. color is gorgeous! Wish i would have read the reviews before i purchased and wore two of these. washed as directed and same outcome as everyone else. basically unwearable unless i maybe use it for a nightshirt. the shrinkage lengthwise was ridiculous. glad i didn\\'t buy every color like i had planned to do! I really lived the detail , fabric, and quality of this tank. however, the sizing seemed disproportionate. it was tight through the bust and loose the waist. i really loved all the colors i purchased online but had to return them because of the sizing. Got charlie trousers last year in a different print in my usual size 4 (5\\'2\", 115#). they initially fit perfectly but stretched out in the thighs and waist and now are loose.  this time i bought a size smaller (size 2). they were snug but i felt them stretch during the first wear and they fit fine now.  i recommend sizing down because they stretch out. love the print for summer (i love anything beachy) and had to have it!  nice comfortable material which isn\\'t hot for summer.  got the regular si The fit on this shirt is bizarre--it very much resembles a nursing top (but wouldn\\'t actually work for that purpose). the side visible in the picture is nicely draped, but the other side can flap open and is completely different. i tried two different sizes and both were equally unfortunate! I ordered this dress in the blood orange and have a few complaints. while it appears to be made with quality, it runs really large. also, in the picture the fabric appears to have a sheen and be somewhat dressy. the actual fabric is just flat cotton. it\\'s a very casual dress, not as dressy as pictured. it\\'s also quite shapeless on. i\\'m returning it. This sweater looks way better in person than in this picture. the secret: try the petite size. loses a star for not having seamed edges , so it might fray or unravel easily-- but of course that clean unseamed cut looks super cute, especially around the neck. also a bit spendy. but let me say again: super cute on. I love this sweater it\\'s so cute and so soft, and warm! I saw this on a model in the house and home catalog. it looked very comfy but with an edge of elegance. i saw it in store in the navy and loved it. the other color is very washed out, not good for me being a blonde. i didn\\'t try it on, and got a small as it looked as it ran a little large. i\\'m 5\\'4\", 130 lbs. and it fit perfectly. it hits above knee, a little longer than on model. it hangs beautifully and the blue color is stunning, looks expensive. i received a few complements the first time i w Fell in love with this dress when i saw it online and ordered it right away. however i was sadly disappointed once it arrived. while the cut is cute, the fabric is just all wrong. i was expecting a nice, heavy knit-like material, but this feels and looks really cheap - especially given the price of the dress. sadly it is going back. I thought i\\'d like this dress in the neutral color. i had to return it it as it was quite unflattering. the skirt made my hips look big and the uneven shape didn\\'t help. the top fit well, in my usual 4 petite, i think it would look nice on some people, as it\\'s something different but i am not one of those it worked on. I ordered this in a l online, and wasn\\'t a fan when i received it. the colors are pretty bright, but they also look cheap in my opinion. it also had an awkward fit, because of the material there is no give at all, it was really tight on my chest (36d) for reference. and it was also pretty short, and i\\'m short! it barely hit the top of my pants...and i\\'m 5\\'2! back it went. I was really excited to get this dress, i initially ordered a small (i am a size 4) but when i tried it on, it was really tight. the bodice at the top fit strangely-i had to shorten the straps quite a bit, and the dress just looked off. i love retailer and get all of my dresses from there, and the look of the dress on line was beautiful, but just didn\\'t fit right. i did love the lace look, and would love seeing more dresses with this design. Loved the open shoulders, but not how large and flowy the rest of it was. i could have worn it 9 months preggo ;) So these look so good online - i love flare and the button detail. however, on me, they were very long (which i knew) but too thigh-hugging for my taste, and the buttons looked cheap (i ordered the tan color). thus, back they went. for reference, i am 5\\'5\" and 125# and ordered the 6. I received this today and will have to send it back. it is super cute and the quality is great. however, you need to wear a bra or a halter bra due to the style which is not a proble, but my 32d chest looked huge in this top so it is going back. I\\'m sure there\\'s someone out there who will look good in this but it certainly wasn\\'t me. admittedly, i\\'m a less than ideal body type at a curvy 5\\' tall. still for a taller person this shirt runs short, for a curvy person this does nothing to accentuate a waist, for a short person this pattern is very busy even if the colors are beautiful, for a busty person the gathers around the chest make for a very frumpy look, and even for a short and thin person this shirt runs too big to get a good fit. c I got this in black. will probably get in the purple print too. the purple is a bit more casual, while the black can be work appropriate if with a nice top. very comfy. Love this sweater!\\r\\nsoft and cozy and the ruffles are not overwhelming.....just a touch of pretty!\\r\\nit will look pretty with a turquoise necklace for a pop of color!\\r\\nclassic, comfy and classy!\\r\\nan anhtro a ++++++++\\r\\nruns very true to size, ordered my usual size an it fits perfectly. Sticker price was a shock but it is so worth it. it is the best little black dress i have ever owned. the lace is so soft and the dress is flattering. it is fun and flirty. this is a closet staple piece for sure!!! love this dress so much! Can dress it up or down and still look good in it! i wear leggings under it to keep my legs warm since the material is thin and i live near the ocean. this is my new standard summer dress! i bought an xxs since i am petite weighing 95lbs and stand 5\\'1\" I am a 10/12 and ordered the m/l. it\\'s very large! i normally take a large in retailer, but i can\\'t figure out my size in this. it\\'s very wide. i love the denim patchwork detail so i will order the s/m and see how it is. They look nice on the page, but they didn\\'t work on my body. made me look big and boxy. maybe if you\\'re super-skinny, they\\'ll be fine. Was excited to try this interesting skirt, as a mega bailey 44 fan. however, this skirt didn\\'t fit well. the waist was fine but it then was boxy and shapeless on me in an xs/size 0. my piece also had a wrinkle from folding and i\\'m not sure how it would easily come out but the main thing is that the lines weren\\'t flattering to the body. the \"vegan\" quilting isn\\'t luxurious. i thought the diagonal zipper style was cool but it doesn\\'t lay to advantage when worn and i\\'m an easy fit. length is so-so, I love this sweater dress! i was hesitant to order it after reading some of the reviews, but fear not, friends--this is a comfortable, flattering, warm dress with a unique twist. i love the cowl and the buttons down the back. the knit is fairly large so there\\'s some give to it, which means pulling it on is a breeze, and the buttons don\\'t slip out of their closures unexpectedly, which is an added bonus. i ordered both grey and navy. i stand at 5\\'6\" and would describe myself as pear-shaped, typica Retailer has incredible service, and so they let me return this dress even after having worn it. however, this dress cannot be cleaned. i saw a stain on it after the first use, so i first tried hand washing it. however, the black part of the dress came off on the white part, making the stain worse. i then tried dry cleaning it (the care tag allows both) and that produced 3 or 4 new stains where the black rubbed off on the white. it\\'s a beautiful, striking dress (that would be great maternit This sweater caught my eye and the positive reviews and pre-holiday sale had me try it. loved the color and cut but surprisingly not the embroidery. i felt like i\\'d wear it a couple of times and then tire of it. my husband and daughter both said, \"meh,\" so back it went. I bought this dress in black and i think it will be a great piece to transition with but definitely great during summer. doesn\\'t come down too low on me which is sometimes an issue. the arm holes seem to be on the larger side. i\\'m 5\\'3 so it is not this short on me. i\\'m really happy with this purchase. plus it has pockets! Alas, i so wanted to love this. the photos of the models wearing it look gorgeous -- flowy, drapey, ultimate grecian goddess. but it just doesn\\'t work unless you\\'re super-skinny. too much material. almost bulky; strange looking. the print is so beautiful -- i love the pink floral, and i love the whole idea of the dress. but it just doesn\\'t work. have to send it back. \\r\\n\\r\\n(i\\'m 5\\'6\", 135 pounds, 38-30-38, and i ordered a 10.) I really wanted to love this dress, but it just didn\\'t fit in anyway. i ordered an xs petite, and it was very large. the lacing in the back is completely useless, and that\\'s what i liked about the dress. i was thinking it would be unlaced more at the top (because of chest) and then lace more tightly near the waist. it was completely closed off and the dress was still very loose and unflattering. beautiful fabric, great color combo, bad fit. Pros:\\r\\n- fits tts. i tried on a size m and it fit well for my 36c and hourglass frame.\\r\\n- the cowl neck gives it a nice touch of class.\\r\\n- love the pop of yellow. not too showy and yet cute and fun.\\r\\n- fabric has a great feel and stretch to it. forgiving fit. \\r\\n- will go with many outfits.\\r\\n-wore a nude bra and had no see-through issues.\\r\\n______________\\r\\ncons:\\r\\n- does seem a tad delicate, easy to snag due to being a knit, but otherwise solid construction.\\r\\n- unlined.\\r\\n______________________\\r\\nrea I ordered this skirt in a size small and when i received it, not only was it too long, but there was also a hole in it. so i returned it. when a small petite became available, i ordered it thinking it would fit better. i just received it and there is a hole in this skirt as well. both skirts also looked as if they had been worn; there was fuzz and lint all over the skirts. i like the skirt but i either have extremely bad luck or it\\'s really bad quality. The sweater runs large, the sweater is designed in such a way that it looks very sloppy. i would never be able to wear it out of the house. however, the material is exceptionally soft and delightful. keeping as its a great stay at home & lounge sweater, but way over priced for this purpose. if you can get the fabric to lay correctly, you\\'re a genius. Love the floral pattern.  top is loose and flowy, as expected.  i like to tick it into my jeans or shorts, so it doesn\\'t look quite so shapeless on me. I am a pretty curvy girl and thought the m/l was gigantic. i returned and was afraid to exchange for the smaller size thinking it would pbly be very large as well. it was not flattering because it was so boxy. I love this jacket and the price was a great bonus. it fit perfectly and is nice cozy and warm. well made and the beige color is great. Bought this dress without trying it on but listened to the previous reviews saying this ran small and wow does it. i usually wear a 6 but ordered an eight which was hard to get on even with the upsizing. i do have a 34ddd bust so i do have a difficult time when dresses have no stretch over give in that area. overall beautiful dress, fabric is not stretchy which killed it for me. There isn\\'t a whole lot that i did like about this dress. the shoulders have large poufs, the fabric isn\\'t very soft, and it\\'s not flattering. maybe with a belt i could be tempted, but i wasn\\'t too fond of the dress. So pretty, love hte design on this one.\\ni tried on hte regualr size, adn will not need a petite, it hit me jsut above my knee. younger gals may oprefer shorter, however.\\n\\nthe aottern is also nice. the cut is flowy and flattering, nothing bad to say about htis dress... Great basic tank with a bit of a \\'flair\\' at bottom that makes it super cute. will layer with cute bra most likely. the coral color is great, too. very pretty. i also got the white. I received this top in the mail today not what i expected at all! it is a great fabric just way too much of it. it is proportionally incorrect width wise. unfortunately this one will be going back. I ordered this dress online. the previous reviews were accurate that it runs small, particularly in the waist. i normally wear a 0 or 2, but i ordered the 4. it fit my waist and hips but was slightly loose at the top even though i am a 34c. i liked the look, but it had a hole where the seams had come apart between the black stripe across the chest and the main fabric. additionally, the black squares were pulled in several places with threads sticking out. i returned it immediately. I ordered this in black and loved it so much, i ordered the \\'red\\' color too. it hasn\\'t arrived yet, but i\\'m hoping its tan like it appears to be online. it fits tts (5\\'3\" and 110lbs) - the xs fit perfectly and wasn\\'t too long. Based on the other reviews, i sized down from my usual 6p to a 2p, but this dress was still ridiculously huge and extremely unflattering. i could tell the minute i took it out of the package it wouldn\\'t work. i can\\'t imagine this would flatter very many people. the front photo of the model is incredibly deceptive. very disappointed--this will be going back for sure. The material is wonderful and the dress is lined. plenty of room in the bodice area for a 36d bust. will be wearing a lot this season. I ordered this in tan and white, but ended up returning it. the material is a bit thin (but soft). the shape of the top was decent, i didn\\'t think it was too boxy but i didn\\'t like how the seams looked on the sides. ultimately i didn\\'t think it was worth the price. I really wanted to love this dress. i love the colors and the design of the dress. unfortunately, i have to agree with one of the other reviewers that this dress makes you look pregnant. it\\'s so voluminous that it\\'s not flattering at all. also agree that the lining is scratchy. I was so excited to get this top in the mail. i loved the colors, print, cut, everything. i put it on and was so disappointed, the top looks so much better on the model. i don\\'t know if i should have gone down a size (i go between an xs and s), but it looked terrible on me! my husband took one look at me in it and said that\\'s being returned. still disappointed This dress looks lovely on the model, but it looks just awful on me!\\ni am 5\\'4\" and curvy. the shoulders are cut w/ a weird shape. instead of a cap sleeve, it is like a pointy cap on the side and stuck out on my shoulders. it looks like i am ready to get beamed into space.\\nthe material is nice and the sequins are pretty, but the cut of the dress is unflattering. This is a beautiful kimono but just isn\\'t made well. the one i received already had a couple small holes and a pull in the thread that was very noticeable. after reading the additional reviewer who wore it an hour and it was already pilling, it is going back for good. such a shame! This is no exception to the rule! i love turtlenecks and this one is going to be a favorite. do know that this is not lightweight-even though this is sleeveless it is definitely a substantial knit. the color is a beautiful nutmeg and can be dressed up or down. i purchased a gorgeous neutral beaded necklace to go with it and it is simply stunning! it does \\'bell out\\' a little at the bottom which, in my opinion-is the only design flaw. i normally wear a medium in most retailer tops and the small is a Most flattering and perfect dark skinny jean! obsessed is an understatement. i am becoming a big fan of mother denim! just enough stretch to be comfortable all day, sit a little bit higher on my waist, which is wonderful (post babies) and sometimes hard to find in jeans. if you are in between sizes, be sure to size down! these jeans are stretchy to begin with and will stretch out a whole size. i have never been happier with a pair of jeans! Retailer consistently provides unique, sophisticated and quality made clothing. with the exception of an occasional purchase at their sister companies, i shop with them exclusively. i suppose that i can\\'t expect 100% perfection from retailer-but 99% of the time-that\\'s what i get. this is that 1%...this sweater is truly awful! i cannot (or find it very difficult at least) begin to describe what this sweater is like but it is so unlike retailer that, had it not been for the distinct pattern on the front I ordered this cardigan on sale and it was a wonderful fit and color. just the light sort of cute pullover i was looking for to keep and wear at work. unfortunately, it is poorly made. i wore it once and it already started to fray and fall apart. after closely inspecting the cause, i realized that the threads in the sweater are not fully sewed together, so the minute you put it on, one will start to unravel leading to a domino effect. it is a shame because the design and cut were truly a great f I\\'m in love with siyu! i saw this jacket/cape and the brilliant colors drew me in. i had to have it. i\\'m so glad i purchased it, it is wonderful. i would say that the colors are a bit more muted than in the puctures, but still a brilliant statement piece. i was considering getting the sleeveless golden mock turtleneck to go with it, but glad i didn\\'t. the neck of the jacket comes up fairly high, and it probably wouldn\\'t have shown. the wool material is very fine, not scratchy, and a bit stretchy I have many pairs of ag jeans -- mostly stevie\\'s & harper\\'s -- and while they\\'re comfortable, i am always glad to take them off at the end of the day. these jeans are different. the fabric is very, very soft & feels like it\\'s been washed & worn dozens of times. but the color & finish of the jean looks polished & spiffy enough to wear for evenings out or casual friday. and the fit is perfect, once i went up a size. slim and figure hugging but not at all constricting. my regular stevie\\'s always fe When i saw this dress online, i immediately passed on it. but i was drawn to it\\'s faint shimmer and soft feel in the store and decided to try it on. i am usually xs - s in dresses and tried the xs (5\\'4, 34b, 27 waist). it fit beautifully. it comes about a couple of inches above my knee and makes me look slim from the side - which isn\\'t typical of shift dresses. i plan on wearing it with flats now and tights and booties when the weather gets cooler. would be a great holiday or new years eve dress Perhaps it is the 69\\'s vibe that hit me, but i had to check this out with the free shipping week. i am so glad that i did!\\r\\ni fear wool as i have sensitive skin but this is soft and snuggly. the structure will allow for fit over many different types of under-layers, but unlike so much offered lately, it is not huge or tent-like, but a perfect fit. it is a heavier weight - light coat weight? this is perfect for me in the south. the color is as pictured, golden. in my xxs petite, the sleeves are p I should have looked more carefully at the description of these before i made the purchase. these jeans, unfortunately are very stretchy which i don\\'t like at all. i was looking for 100% cotton with no lycra-love rigid denim so these are not for me. they have a very nice design and fit tts. they are very long so expect hemming if you are not 5\\'10 at least! the 29 was perfectly sized and will be flattering on a curvy figure, i would imagine. rear pockets are placed very low on the bottom giving t Like another reviewer, i really wanted to love this dress. everything about this screamed perfection: the length, the cut, the stripes, but the fit was really off for me. i\\'m 5\"10\" and am usually between a size 8 and 10. i tried the 8 and the body fit well but the chest and straps were entirely too large (i\\'m a 34d). so i tried the size 6 and chest and straps fit but the body pulled at the buttons. normally, i\\'m all for tailoring to fit, but chest would have needed to be reconstructed which isn\\' My normal size m fit well but i wouldn\\'t want it to shrink any. hangs well. Beautiful dusty rose color! the fit is fabulous! love the sleeve and hem length! very flattering and does not cling. This dress was so pretty on the hanger but a saggy sack on. even the sz 0 was too loose and shapeless. there is no waist as pictured. the hi-low hem, loose fit and wavy waist seam (see in the third close-up picture) make it look like the dress shrunk oddly in the wash. it\\'s really too bad, it\\'s such a pretty combination of patterns. I loved the aesthetic but as a true hourglass shape, i was frustrated that it didn\\'t have a little more give as i tried to pull it over my head. the fabric was stiff, and seemed to be lace over cotton? not entirely sure. i couldn\\'t get past the feeling off the material. I love the pattern and style of the dress, but unfortunately, it\\'s doesn\\'t fit quite right. the top is too loose (the clip doesn\\'t work well) and the waist line of the dress sit above the waist. and the sleeves are tight (which is shocking to me because i have skinny arms). I loved this shirt! flattering and pretty. it\\'s hand wash only or dry clean. i hand washed it and the blue t-shirt part of the shirt shrank, and now the front of the shirt is too short for me. would not recommend due to shrinkage... too bad. I\\'m usually a fan of maeve, but this dress is just bad. the fabric is thin and filmy, and it stretches to sheer over your chest. the turtleneck is neither tight nor loose, it just droops in a most unfortunate way. I love this top, but i washed it once, in cold water, and hung it dry. it shrunk just enough that it\\'s now too tight around the bust and gaps open up between buttons there. so disappointing! i will have to send it back. This is a beautiful tunic. i wanted it to work so much but i couldn\\'t get past the itch factor. also, the sleeves were shorter than i expected. when i wore a light tee underneath, it didn\\'t move well and looked bulky so sadly it went back to the store. if the material doesn\\'t bother you, buy this. would look great w/ tights/leggings and boots. We always hope that the dress looks just like it is pictured i would say that this dress is more of an emerald green rather then a paler mint green . that said it is very forgiving stylewise because it does not cling and show your lumps and bumps . however the material is very thin like a sheet. length is good it is right to the knee on my 5\\'3\" frame. armholes are well positioned and not too big as to show bra or undergarments .\\r\\n not so sure how it would hold up over an evening or afternoon wea I ordered this in a medium and although the details/design of the shirt were cute, the \"swing\" did not work for me this time around. i typically like looser fitting tops, but with this shirt i felt like there was just too much material and made me feel like i was wearing a tent. This is a great top and it fit me very nicely but it\\'s much longer than it appear to be in the picture. i\\'m 5\\'2 and it was more like a tunic than a tank on me. if it were shorter it would be one of my favorite staples i\\'m sure. if you\\'re very tall i think you will love it. I&#39;m taller (5&#39;8), so it&#39;s not uncommon for things to be too short on me, but this was really short for the style.  it was very wide and loose all over in my usual size - both up top and in the wavy part below.  the style really just did not work with the length.  it looked very odd. This dress looks cute online, but it is enormous. i bought a small, but it looked more like a 3x plus size. i tried it on, just in case, and honestly it looked like a great dress for a clown. this dress must have had two feet of fabric pinned behind the model in the photo. The dress is beautiful in pictures, but all the reviews are dead on...it was full of snags when it arrived! 8 snags to be exact. and the fabric was heavier than i expected. sadly, had to return. Love love this sweater/shirt. i have worn it out to dinner and work with leggings. it is soft and comfy. the pleats in the back are beautiful and do not require constant ironing. i even bought it in the pink. The sweater is very comfy and looked good the first time i tried it on, however the material is thin and slightly see through.\\nalso, after one wear it completely stretched out and made the long sleeves awkward to wear without washing in between each wear. after the third time i wore it, i discovered a large hole in the armpit, most likely due to the excessive washing. i would not recommend this sweater. This dress looks like it would be so much fun to wear. when i tried it on, i was swimming in it. i do have to admit that the movement of the dress (had it fit right) would have been very fun. i was also really disappointed with the lining. there is dark green piping along the neckline, which bled through the pink of the dress and make it look like you dropped something on your dress. returning it :( Not being into bright neon colors, i love this top! the fit is true to size and helps to hide my tummy. it\\'s super cute and very flattering. Love retailer\\'s kimonos and when i saw this pattern i had to have it! unfortunately, when i bought it the tag was already showing holes so they gave me 15% off... went to wear it for the first time, there was already a huge snag in it! i love retailer but for 98$ this is not worth your money. Ditto to all of the reviews who state that this top is beautiful but runs small in the bust. i am a large or an xl so i ordered this in the xl. i\\'m a little broad and busty and it was too small/binding. this is a beautiful well made top for a certain body type. As others have said, this dress does run large. i ordered the xxs petite, and ti isalmsot big on me (hips are wide, so at least, it is comfortable in width). material is a bit scratchier than i am used to s well.\\n\\ncolor is great, and it looks nice when i see it on my stylist, who convinced me to hold on to it for a little... thinking about it.\\n\\nmy zipepr was also a little hard to work.\\n\\nshorter than some other dresses... I loved the print and fabric of this dress when i first saw it, but trying it on was a very different story! the photo seems to show a wider, more well-defined waist, with just a small amount of \"blousing\" on top, but this was not the case. yes, the waist fit, but it is a narrow band that was covered completely by the hanging over of the ill-fitting top, turning the entire look into a shapeless and very unattractive fit. sadly, this is going right back! This dress was very boxy and unflattering. i really wanted to like it because the blue and white details were so pretty but it had to go back. I wanted to like this sporty dress too. i teach at an elementary school and like to get down on my knees st my students level - plus we can get messy most days with our learning and most days are go - go - go being \"on\" every second...the armholes were cut too big and weirdly squared. i didn\\'t like the middle \"ridge\" either as it was unflattering. it was returned. Pretty top online - okay in person. runs small, especially on bottom hemline. thought it would have a swing to it. it does not. more sheer in person than i thought it would be. that wouldn\\'t stop me from keeping it though. it was the way it laid on my chest that was unflattering. looked like i was wearing a bib. i don\\'t have a large chest, just weird look on me. unfortunate, because it is an adorable print. top made for thinner or a petite lady. I love this romper!  i am 5\\'2 and the medium fit great and wasn\\'t long.  i\\'m short so i thought i would have to hem this!  it\\'s comfortable and, although, i\\'m not a huge fan of gauze, the fit was perfect.  i had to\\r\\nsnatch it! Love,love, love this. it is so different and unique. definitely not something you will see in any other store. wore it last week and have never received so many compliments on one piece. so retailer!!!!!! it was very warm and comfortable. i did wear a turtleneck under this, because of reviews of itching. i did not have any problems. I love this top, it is a very soft material and it looks very classy.. i have worn it with a skirt for work and skinny jeans. i have a bigger bust and i wear a small, it is true to size. very classy!! Actually you would think just another tshirt but actually with the wide straps it changes it up enough to really be cute.  i like the look it adds.  i really want to get more colors.   i normally wear everything from retailer in small , and even though this fit it was small for a small.  i will keep it but i think i will buy others in medium. And this one proved to be no different. the short end of it; this dress is pretty much super thick, heavy linen with a rope like collar (the supposed embroidery you see), and there is no lining, but completely unnecessary pockets. i\\'m typically a 2 or 4 depending on the designer (5\\'7 & a super fit 135 lbs) and knew enough to order an xs in this, however it still fit like a potato sack. even upon taking it out of the plastic bag, i knew it was going back. between the unrealistic pictures and lack This is a lovely dress, the shape is really flattering and it\\'s light and easy to wear. the only problem i have is it runs a little big - i\\'m normally a 6-8 and i\\'m sizing down to a 4. otherwise it\\'s pretty perfect, the length is good for taller women (i\\'m 5\\'11\") and the bodice is sturdy enough that smaller cup sizes won\\'t need a bra. definitely recommend this! I wanted to love this, was so excited when i ordered it online. the fabric (blue and white) was beautiful, but the cut was bad. it fit me like a maternity top, and made me look like i was 6 months along. i have a feeling that the models had theirs pinned back, in the back, because it does not lay flat like that in front, it has a lot of fabric with no place to go but up and out. returning. This top came in the mail today and did not disappoint. it feels very light and luxurious and the color is just divine. i got the deep red color and it is beautiful. it can be dressed up or dressed down. i ordered my usual small and it fit tts. I am 5,7\" 135 lbs the small fit well in the bust but no shape . it was just big and frumpy . it went back . Overall nice material and styling but be prepare for it to be huge. i purposely sized down and i still felt like i was swimming in this. In maeve i run between a size 2-4.  my regular size 4 was too tight in the shoulders, the fabric didn\\'t drop off the shoulders like it does on the model.  it also felt too tight near the back were the button is, almost as if there was not enough fabric.  the sleeves were also too short and tight around the arms.  sized up to a 6 and all those issues were fixed.  since this top is billowy anyway the size up really didn\\'t mess with the shape of the top.  love the gold color, so pretty! Oh what a disappointment! i was looking forward to wearing this as a layering piece with the shawl cardigan. the material lacks serious quality and it was ripped on the seam. so, back it goes. and, i am flabbergasted at the price retailer is charging almost $60 for this top! While i loved the material, color and concept of the dress, it was much too large and sack-like. i\\'m 5\\'2\" and 108 lbs, pear-shaped. i purchased the regular xs given stated length in the description. while the length was just right, it was just much too large throughout. i\\'m not sure that even an xxs will help so sadly, this will be going back. Like the other reviewer said this top is extremely wide and boxy. it must be pinned in the picture online. it\\'s very frustrating when they do that. thank goodness i didn\\'t pay for shipping! for reference, i\\'m 5\\'2 and 135 pounds and bought the xxs, it\\'s going back for sure. i\\'m trying to lose baby weight, not trying to look pregnant! Really loved this dress online and was excited to try it out. when it arrived it was heavy & bulky in the package which didn\\'t bode well. taking it out of the bag, i was surprised at how heavy & thick it was. the picture really looks like it would be a flowy, grecian dress to throw on during a hot summer day ? but in the reality you might drown in sweat. the interior linings promised absolutely no breathing fabric.\\r\\n\\r\\nwanted to love this as the style is very cute but was disappointed by the mate I have a curvy figure and have always loved the way pilcro jeans have fit aka plenty of stretch for butt and thighs and small waist. i was really excited to try their skinny,  high waisted version. first, i don\\'t like the faux whiskering on the jeans, i think it makes them look cheap. second, the fabric had more stretch than i\\'m use to for pilcro denim, and made them feel low quality.  i don\\'t think they are terrible, i just think i should have been more careful about reading the percentages of Bought this top in black and i love it! fits true to size with arms a little snug but because of the stretch in the fabric it is fine. the top is very flattering and looked like the model. the front is shorter but very flattering! love it. Beautiful color and the fabric is very substantial and soft. but, they didn\\'t finish the bottom hem! the dress is lined and the bottom inside has a ribbon sewn in as a type of hem, but the actual edge is just cut and not turned in on itself. because of this the whole bottom had a hundred little fabric frays. the rest of the dress is so polished it just doesn\\'t make sense. also, while the fabric is beautiful my dress had a weird mark on the chest, almost like a water mark. just overall bad attent I\\'m 5\\'8 128lbs and bought a size 2. i loved this dress, but didn\\'t expect to have to go bra-less or wear a tube top under. the top lands much lower than i expected but the rest of the dress was lovely. \\r\\n\\r\\ni ordered a size 2 Received the jacket today -- i love it but because it has no stretch in the material it feels a little snug across the shoulders. i have long arms and it fit perfect for the length. i tried to order the next size to see how it would fit, but it was sold out! i\\'ll keep looking for it to be back in stock. What a wonderful find! yes, it runs big. .. and beautiful! love the quality, and design. very light and airy. this is great for me because i\\'m not short & i am busty & i love tunics. this item can be dressed up or played down with class. the lining is a perfect complement to the tunic as well and fits nice with the garment. i am usually to busy to write a review, but i felt obligated on this item. five stars! I\\'m not really sure what the designer was trying to accomplish with this dress. the fabrics and details are pretty but the shape is really strange. for one thing, the dress has a very straight cut so there is not a lot of room for movement and the thin belt makes the shape even worse. i felt like i was wearing a really fancy garbage bag. also, the way the bottom flares out is just strange considering the cut and length. i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it was a complete miss The dress looks great both in winter and summer, either paired with tights and a light jacket or on its own. it runs true to size--was able to buy it online. the fabric is great for all day wear--doesn\\'t wrinkle too much.\\n\\nthe only con is that the darts over the breasts are a little pointy for my taste, but i still love the dress. I was excited to receive this tunic in the red (more of a rose color) yet so disappointed to find out how large it runs. my usual size with retailer is a small (sometimes, xs). after reading through the reviews, i ordered an xs and even the xs is too big -- just too much fabric. unfortunately, the xxs is sold out and the xs will be returned. This top is comfortable and flattering. i really like the simplicity- a wearable basic summer top, with a cute twist, just enough to make it contemporary, but not overstated. I love most pure and good clothing pieces, mostly because the fit and fabric are comfy and made of good quality materials. this tunic does deliver on both counts, but i is very, very long and straight up and down.\\nfyi: i have a boyish figure, having no waist/hips. i have a broad shoulder/back, so the cowl neckline coupled with the very long and straight tunic doesn\\'t really flatter my body. it would be okay for just haging around the house, but i wouldn\\'t feel comfortable wearing this tunic out Saw this one online and when it came it did not disappoint. i ordered a xxs in black, and it was perfect. i am 5\\'3\" and 110 lbs. it definitely has a lot of volume to it, but i still found it flattering because the shirt is very sheer, so you can \"see\" through it to your thinner figure underneath. it comes with a comfortable but fitted camisole to wear under it, which makes it flattering. another reviewer mentioned the beading turning. i have not seen that on mine, but now i will be looking for i I loved this blouse when i got it and wore it before washing. it fit really well and was flattering. the only time i laundered it i hand- washed it in cold water and hung it to dry. the blouse shrunk at least a full size and in awkward places. the sleeves are now tight and way too short. the overall length shortened by at least 2 inches. the top is so tight in the bust now that the buttons popped open. i\\'m very disappointed and surprised.i will be returning it as it is unwearable as is. I got this top in an xs and the fit is great. the top is a little darker than pictured. it looks great with white, kaki and denim. Just purchased this for a midsummer formal wedding. i am 5\\'6\\'\\' 125 lbs, ended up going with the size 2 for extra room, the 0 felt very snug thru the chest. Classic design with nice details. stays in place for those active bikini wearers. I saw this dress and immediately started daydreaming about wearing it while honeymooning in italy along the amalfi coast or the cinque terre with my husband. and then i tried this dress on and immediately woke up. the cut is a disaster, the quality is terrible, and the dress just plain didn\\'t work. the strips of elastic were sewn unevenly, giving the appearance that there was one large breast and one non-existent breast. the neckline was so long that it had to have the elastic run over the outsi This dress was so cute and comfortable! i said it runs big, but i think that may also simply be the style of it. i paired it with some cute boots and received many compliments! love it!! The jacket runs large so size down. it\\'s a good jacket to throw on the go. but i don\\'t see this lasting long bc after he first wash, it started piling. the quality of the material isn\\'t great! I got the xs and it fits perfectly, almost an a line cute slightly fuller on the bottom, not too form fitting and not too loose. i am 5\\'1\" and the length is not short as it appears in the photo on the model. the yellow flower pattern is super cute. material is soft and comfy. This blouse has such a beautiful print but then it just goes down from there and can\\'t be saved. the fabric is a sheer silk so it comes with an attached camisole that just doesn\\'t lay right underneath. the sleeves are all gathered up and they have a puffy gather at the top that just ruins the whole blouse. i wish it was just a simple popover type blouse because it really is a lovely print. definitely not worth the money even at 1/2 off plus 25-%. This dress looks like it could be cute on but when you put it on its just blah. i saw someone else trying it on in the fitting room and she felt the same. not cute, not flattering, the model photo is deceiving. would not recommend, although it looks airy and comfy. This top is beautiful and fits true to size, 4ft 11inches and 114 lbs and i purchased the xs. i was at the montclair location today and they had this top in white, lavendar, the pattern which is displayed online and gray. the white was see through so you will definitely have to wear an under garment with it. this top will be perfect for the spring with a cardigan or by itself in the summer. i still have a little stomach left over from my second pregnancy and this top hides it well. i decided to This blouse has too much drapey fabric and it\\'s just not flattering.  in the front part of the blouse the fabric is relatively short, but the sleeves have so much excess fabric it almost looks like a clown suit.  sending back. I don\\'t normally review my purchases, but i was so amazed at how poorly this dress was made, i couldn\\'t help myself but to post a review. the neck line isn\\'t even hemmed down so it flaps up. the material is thin and feel cheap. this dress isnt even worth $20 in my opinion. i was expecting a well made, good quality dress for the high price tag. I\\'ve been looking for dresses to wear to nurse in since i just had a baby & so i bought this dress knowing it just had a tack holding the front fold together & always intending to remove the tack. i love it. the fabric is super soft. i wear it with a nursing tank underneath and a wide belt to cinch my waist & it\\'s amazing. with the tack in, it did pull very strangely across the bust as others have mentioned, so it\\'s not good for a big bust unless you intend to remove the tack & wear something un The blue color is sublime - the material velvet iridescent cool - the fit is loose and not something to wear to show off your figure but it is has a cool swingy boho vibe that was what i was expecting ... add a cool shirt jacket to elevate it and give it more structure This didn\\'t work for me.  the piece looked cheap, rode very high...needed to be longer.  the piece looks incomplete for some reason to my eyes.  it also does not seem quality for an retailer piece.  this went back. This is an extremely flattering dress. i couldn\\'t resist buying it, even though i didn\\'t come into the store looking for a dressier dress, which i feel this is. once i tried it on, i had to purchase it. its one of those things that i know i won\\'t regret because at some point, an occasion will show up that i\\'ll wear it to. its soft, comfy and flowing and accentuates the body\\'s curves without being too tight or clingy. its a classic! I ordered this in xxs petite, and it fit nicely, the green color was nice, the cut was just above the knee, flattering, but not wow. it is nice if you need a casual dress to hang around, go to the beach, playground with kids, etc., but there were just better options for me. so i returned it. the size fit me well at 115 lbs, 30dd chest. i say go for it, if you need a nice soft casual dress, ok to size down. I thought these were very nice bermuda shorts. i have skinnier legs and i didn\\'t see a problem with them being too baggy there. the olive color was nice, very comfortable material. I purchased this top on sale and was really excited about the style. it fit great the first time i wore it. i washed it once, according to the care instructions. after washing it in cold water and allowing it to air dry, it was basically ruined. it shrunk up in length widened out about two inches. i\\'m pretty bummed about it because it was cute. The lines on the dress are lovely. the material is a nice thick jersey, which can be body-hugging, but mostly on top. it falls beautifully and looks good with heels and flats and boots. i am xs or s depending on the dress, and i got the xs in this one. This top is really comfortable but dressy enough for a business/casual office. the fit is nice and loose without making you look larger than you are. i get a lot of compliments every time i wear this. I really wanted to like this top. in person though, the fit was too large and boxy. i did order a smaller size based on other reviews but it was still too sacklike. i got the grey motif pattern which i thought was quite pretty and interesting. the material was nice and lightweight. perhaps it would look better on someone with a straight figure and small bust. I love off the shoulder looks and had high hopes for this top. unfortunately the folded top portion doesn\\'t stay down at all. i found myself pulling at it all day and eventually gave up. the material is also not the best. What the picture doesn\\'t show, is that there are pockets on the side seams that do add a bit to the hip area. also, the dress runs very large, in my opinion. i ordered a medium (my usual size) and everything was loose. i am going to exchange it for a small and hope the proportions stay the same because it\\'s very pretty.\\n\\nit is very boxy, and kind of nightgown looking when it\\'s big, so if you wouldn\\'t want it to cling a bit this might not be a good dress. the fabric is gorgeous and soft, but be a This piece is comfortable and easy to pair with leggings or denim. soft and not too heavy. My normal size m fit well but i wouldn\\'t want it to shrink any. hangs well. I was so excited to try this sweater on when it arrived but to my disappointment, it was overly large! i was pratically swimming in it. really love the design and the way it looks on the model. just didn\\'t work out that way on me. I bought these last year and loved them, however they came in tall sizes. this year they do not and the inseam is just way too short, even at 33\". im 5\\'7\" and  they barely graze the floor with no break in the pant leg. i prefer to wear them with boots and they will not be long enough even with a short heal I found this dress at my local retailer must be a web order return i feel in love with it once i put it on its better in person that online but it does run a little tight in the chest area  it was fine for me as i\\'m not big busted Loved the print/pattern and the light grey.....i think it might have been better if reversed (it has a v in the back, and the front neckline was very intrusive and scratchy to me). i\\'m normally a small but got this in a medium and it was very short on me. wish it could have worked but returning it. Very nice fabric and quality but runs very large. i had to return my pair of a size 0. stinks to pay for shipping on a product that looks so different in the picture. Not sure who this is for but its not for me. skirt was long, stiff and puffy on my hips. i could not get it to lie correctly. maybe you have to be 6\\' to pull this off... Unlike the other two reviews , i found this dress horrid. i ordered a xs since i am between that and a s. it was just too much fabric for me. . i have a small frame, so it was just so overwhelming, the armholes were big and i felt like i had a bag on me. colors were nice and fabric was soft and light.. the belt made no sense as others have said. length was good. i tried it on as soon as i got it and couldn\\'t take it off fast enough. i literally ran to the post office and back it goes. this is my Tried this twice in yellow because for the price it seems like it would be such a useful piece, but the quality is below average for an retailer dress. it\\'s just a shapeless, thin, beach cover-up that i could\\'ve picked up anywhere. the yellow color is so cute though. if you\\'re looking for a light, breezy, go-to-the-beach dress that you can shove in a bag with your towel, this might be good for you, but it\\'s too thin for just about anything else. As soon as i saw this dress online i loved it and ordered it! unfortunately it just didn\\'t work for me, i tried it in a small, medium and large. for reference i\\'m 5\\'2\", 145lbs, 36d. the dress is really pretty in person, but i looked like a little girl in it. my daughter who is 4\\'9\", 100lbs, 34a, also tried it on and she too looked like a little girl in it. the material is beautiful along with the detail at the neckline, however the neckline is not open like in the picture, it\\'s more pushed toget I wanted to love this top. perfect weight, length, and shape. unfortunately, the seam goes right through the bust and just does not look right. if you are tiny on top, this will be lovely on you. Absolutely love everything about this sweater. i was hesitant to buy because it\\'s so oversized and i was worried it would overwhelm my small frame. but the xs fits great, i love the large knit look and the bell sleeves. pairing with dark denim skinny jeans helped balance out the sweaters oversized shape. wore it work and then to a party and received compliments on it all day. This dress hangs horribly. unlike the photo, the waist does not cinch. too bad. the colors are great and the quality of the material is nice. because i bought it on sale, i may try to tailor it to work, but unless you are willing to do that, its a no go. :-( The sweater is cute, but scratchy. Just received this in the mail, tried it on and am smitten. i\\'m usually a l, but sometimes i\\'m a xl (if no stretch), in retailer tops. i bought this one in l and i\\'m sure glad i did. very flowy, stretchy and comfortable. i also bought the meda lace top from one september and they are very similar expect this is more of a t-shirt and the other is more of a blouse. i almost think i could\\'ve gotten a m in this because there is a lot of extra fabric at the chest which is usually never the issue for me It\\'s the print that attracted me when i was in the store. it is beautiful, but i fear it demands darker skin and hair. if you have problems with yellow, then don\\'t buy. i don\\'t mind the transparency of the fabric because it is not noticeable if you wear a flesh colored cami underneath. because the fabric is light and the shape boxy, it is meant to be flowing, so i purchased my regular size. if you have small breasts you would probably prefer a smaller size. i only wish the blouse had been a litt Just recently purchased and think it\\'s ok for the price. would never pay full on this one & that\\'s from an retailer shopper who\\'s purchased plenty at full price. design is cute but definitely looks like a sleep shirt esp in the lighter color, so-so on construction - the bottom seams pucker slightly, the pockets bunch up weirdly (steaming/laundering don\\'t help) & the shoulders also hunch up oddly. could be because of the thicker fabric sewn to the knit but laundering didn\\'t help that issue either. Amazing! they are like those cozy, wool socks. they are true to size. they don\\'t stretch out (at least yet), even after i stretched, etc . i am going to get another pair since i envision wearing these often in the cold house. I love the idea of this top and ordered it in white. it is a great design and proportion is nice with jeans. the front is off white t shirt material with a pocket and the back is a light grey heathered panel. i am returning it as it is very thin and the quality is cheap looking. if the grade of material had been a bit thicker and better made, then it would have been a winner! Remember those cable-knot cotton sweaters that were popular in the eighties?! that\\'s exactly what this sweater is. everywhere your body bends like elbows is emphasized by the fact that cotton does not bounce back like other finer fabrics like wool and cashmere. i\\'ll pass on this! How cute was this little sweater and comfortable even in the south .... until i washed it! i followed the instructions on the label being careful not to wring it out. first of all, the smell was unbelievable! i washed it three days ago and it is still wet and damp and on top of that, it shrunk. even though i handwashed it, line dried it and pampered it to no end! Tried this twice in yellow because for the price it seems like it would be such a useful piece, but the quality is below average for an retailer dress. it\\'s just a shapeless, thin, beach cover-up that i could\\'ve picked up anywhere. the yellow color is so cute though. if you\\'re looking for a light, breezy, go-to-the-beach dress that you can shove in a bag with your towel, this might be good for you, but it\\'s too thin for just about anything else. I am always looking for a shirt that\\'s a little different yet as comfortable as a normal t-shirt (running after a 1 year old i need comfort). i bought two colors and love the vibrant pink/salmon and the dark purple (which i think it said was blue for some reason). the material is nice and the cut is feminine. I was excited to see this dress as i\\'d bought the sparrow boiled wool sheath dress in xs last year and loved the fit. however, this dress does not fit the same way. the top fits fine, but the waist and the bottom are way too big. i laid it over my sparrow dress from last year, and the bottom is at least an inch wider (two inches, if you go by the total circumference). i\\'m planning to exchange for an xxs and see if that one fits better. The colors on this sweater are cute, the fabric is good quality and not too thick for spring. the fit is tts. This shirt is so stunning. the photo does this shirt no justice. what you can\\'t see from the image are the tiny gold threads that are woven throughout the shirt. they run vertically.and are very subtle and seen only up close. so pretty. also the detail in the chest area is perfect. i love this shirt. This is different from any bra i\\'ve had before, in a good way. the lace over the front is really beautiful, and no annoying straps means it\\'s comfortable! fit and support are both great. i didn\\'t notice that it was silk when i ordered, so it was a nice surprise to open something so luxe and elegant. i wasn\\'t expecting an underwire, either, based on the s-m-l sizing, but it has one. I own many blouses by tiny. the arms on this blouse billow out which was not flattering or thinning on me. the shirt was just blah. But it runs super small. i wear a medium for everything but couldn\\'t come close to buttoning this. the buttons were about 4 inches apart (horizontally)\\n\\nprobably should have ordered an extra large in order to fit. the quality and styling seemed great but ordering online requires \"truth in sizing\" I ordered the navy/gray combo in size xl. it was too heavy and uncomfortable to wear. it also attracted so much lint. the one i received must have come from a store because it already had a lot of fuzz on it. it added weight and was unflattering for my shape. the colors do match the photos online. the length also matches the model\\'s photos. it just didn\\'t work for me. I\\'m a 32ddd and this top fit perfect. i wore it with boyfriend jeans and flats. the material is nice and perfect for fall I ordered this in tan and white, but ended up returning it. the material is a bit thin (but soft). the shape of the top was decent, i didn\\'t think it was too boxy but i didn\\'t like how the seams looked on the sides. ultimately i didn\\'t think it was worth the price. So i ordered a 0 and p0. when i received them i could tell right away that i\\'d prefer the 0 and it looked to be the perfect size. then i tried to slip it on over my shoulders...it was tight. it was the right size but it was so hard to get on over my shoulders and then to take it off i needed my husband\\'s help. it fit great otherwise. i loved the feel of the fabric...the design of the bodice. going up a size would not help me as then it would be too large in the bust area...i\\'m a 32b but i do hav I\\'m so disappointed this dress didn\\'t work out! i ordered the size medium, post baby i\\'m a solid dress size 6 or 8 depending on the designer.\\r\\nthe cashier was laughing with me how ridiculously huge this garment was when i held it up. \\r\\n\\r\\nalso the length was super long, description says 35\" which would be mid thigh for me, but this thing hit me mid knee. also, like the previous review the shoulders are tented and poofy. so bizarre and the cut reminds me of a maternity dress, but the shoulders def Beautiful top but it didn\\'t fit. i am small chested with wide shoulders, normally wear a xs or s - ordered the xs and it swallowed me. Do not buy this dress for full price. the design looks great but after receiving the dress, the material is made of extremely cheap slinky-ish polyester that you would find at a f21 store. the stitching is horrific and created an uneven \"hump\" on the back seam. just absolutely poor poor quality. I saw these in my local retailer and loved them on the hanger. when i tried them on, not so much. the material is a pretty substantial white denim and very stretchy (i didn\\'t find them to be that smooth of a fabric, but more of a traditional denim texture). i am a 6-8 in pants, and normally wear a 27 in pilcro denim. when i tried on the size 27 in the store, i found them to be very tight in the thighs - and i don\\'t have big thighs. i also found the pants to pull conspicuously across the crotch are Love at first sight (via the internet); upon arrival, i was on the fence.\\n.\\nthe fabric is slinky and loose; so much so that i should have ordered a medium instead of a large\\n(perhaps then the dress would have then been more of an a-line fit vs. an over sized dress with no body).\\nthe lower section of the sleeves is attached intricately to the upper arms;\\nevery slight movement of the body is followed by a slight tug at the sleeve/arm cloth;\\notherwise, when the arms are extended, the sleeves do hav I wanted this dress to work so badly but if you have any chest or any hips this won\\'t work for you. i tried in petites and regular and it just didn\\'t work at all I thought this dress was lovely on. i\\'m an 8/10 and tried the med which i believe was the right fit. it may have fit a little large but i liked the way it hung. it has pockets and the color is absolutely beautiful. definitely buying if it makes it to sale. I i hesitate to say that i don\\'t recommend this dress,it really is so pretty,but a different fabric might have worked better. more importantly,the cut is not right,for me anyway. the neckline is a little high and the dress starts to flare out from the lower end of your boobs and continues all the way down giving a very wide lower half,way too much fabric at the bottom....looks like a triangle . if they\\' done a scoop neck and a shift style it would have been perfection The fabric on this dress is gorgeous. i wish it was tailored a bit more because as it is, it looks like a muumuu. i wish it would have fit better, but i returned it. Sooo this adorable blouse is indeed different than pictured. no ruffle, such a bummer, sleeves are much longer, and yes it\\'s teared in the front and back. also the button opening on the back is much longer/larger, in my opinion. i\\'ll most likely keep it, but consider the mentioned if buying. When i ordered this online, i should have paid more attention to the picture. the dress comes to the knees of the 5\\'10\" model. i was swimming in small petite size. i checked the label and wondered whether i received the wrong size. nope, it was ps. either the dress was mislabeled, or this is cut huge. returning. too bad because the shape and color are cute. First problem-i would not have ordered this at all had the description been correct. the fabric description is cotton which the dress is most certainly not. secondly, it has a really funky, cheap, unfinished, raw-hemmed slip which is simply not fitting for the dress. the keyhole in the front is super long-again, does not seem to fit the dress. i am not happy with this piece at all but it did fit tts. length is just above knee. i am 5\\'5\" 142 lbs 34d and the six was a good fit. sending this home t The quality of this jacket is outstanding. color combination is very chic and sophisticated. jacket is warm but not bulky. I love the style of this swimsuit on the model. when i purchased is i didn\\'t realize that there was no support (wire/ padding/ lining) in the chest. the rest of the swimsuit was great but i did not like the look in the chest - it provided no support. i ended up returning it. This dress is incredible soft and flattering. it sits higher on the waist than most other dresses i\\'ve received from retailer, which is actually great for me, as i have a short torso. i have been able to put it in with the regular wash cycle, which was a pleasant surprise. the only issue was with the overlapping fabric on the top; i ended up adding an extra stitch to avoid being totally exposed. I love this dress, the only issue is i ordered on-line and it came from a store location not the warehouse so it came dirty on the bottom and wrinkled! \\r\\nonce i washed it (yes its washable) it looked fantastic!!! This is a very pretty dress with a unique bodice and neckline. however, it seems to run small on top. i can not zip up the top by myself (zipper is in the back) even though i usually wear a size 2 or xs in this brand (i\\'m a 32d so i\\'m narrow on top). i haven\\'t decided yet if i\\'m keeping it because despite the sizing issue, the dress is lovely! The print of this dress is what enticed me, and it did not disappoint. the fabric is a nice shade of medium grey with cream printing. however, the fabric is very thin. thankfully the top part is lined, but the bottom is not and it should be. this lightweight dress great for hot summer days, but for the price it really should be lined on the bottom as well. \\r\\nthe dress is more a-line than pictured, which i liked. the bust is fitted and there is elastic in back. the skirt is fairly loose and flare I received this today and totally bummed it\\'s not cold enough where i live to where this yet. this style of sweater is what initially hooked me into retailer. it looks like one you\\'d have up in your closet for years. good quality, feels nice, and i love the detail on the sleeve. kind of wish they\\'d put a little detail on the back, maybe a peek a boo detail of a small flower or another ladybug but overall i\\'m very pleased. This is the oddest fitting pullover. there is too much fabric around the chest. it is fitted everywhere else but then balloons out in the front. i liked it at first but really started to dislike all the bunchiness (is that a word?). i gave it away.. This sweater/jacket is great over any blouses. love the color. it looks more slightly peachy cream color that i love! goes with everything. warm. i thought it ran true to size. i ordered a small and love the way it fits. if you are looking for more of an oversized piece then you would need to size up. Very feminine! comes with a coordinating cami. i liked it so much that i\\'m going to order the other color, too! This dress is a good casual summer dress. the material is thin and feels nice on. the dress was very wrinkled when it arrived but that came out very easily and the fabric doesn\\'t really wrinkle easily after initial wash and steam. the color is very vibrant and the fit is loose. however, if you have a larger chest (i\\'m a 34c), the hook and eye closure dones come undone. overall a good purchase. it looks good with a belt as well. As someone with a large chest and a smaller waist, i found this top incredibly unflattering (and i like swingy tops). it was too short, too wide in the hips, and too tight in the bust. the pattern and fabric are very pretty though. I wanted to like this but it just didn\\'t have much of a shape, not flattering at all. maybe if i was taller? It is a beautiful top but runs huge!!! i followed other reviews and ordered a size down hoping it would work but it was totally unflattering! i wanted so bad to love it but there was no way i could keep it!! Ref: 5\\'4\", 125# 27/4, 32g. i don\\'t think this is for us shorter women. this hits you right where you don\\'t want a vertical line to hit. it flares out at your hip and makes you look shorter than you are. the fabric is like a double gauze and very soft and the colors are beautiful but i couldn\\'t even dream of making this work. i thought maybe with my larger bust it would create shape but it looks like i just wrapped a bunch of fabric around me! glad i tried in-store and didn\\'t online order. I was very excited to find a fun and lightweight white dress for spring/summer. for the past two years i have found two of my favorite white dresses. the material that this dress is made out of did not look high quality at all. the fit looked more like that of an old nightgown. this dress has no shape to it, although probably comfortable, not flattering. i had high hopes for this dress and wish that it looked like it does in the picture, in person. I really wanted to love this dress, but i think the proportions are very weird. i\\'m 5\\'7\" and usually go for an eight in unstructured dresses and a 10 in more structured dresses.\\nit runs small throughout, and is too short for me to feel comfortable wearing to work. the front is nicely detailed, but the back looks weirdly forgotten and could use more detailing. i tried on three different sizes (8,10,and 12) and they all pulled weirdly at the chest. there\\'s a little slip that goes with the dress, w The blouse looked better on the model. i liked the way it fit, just not how it looks. the fabric made me itch, which was one of the other reasons i returned it. i wished it had looked good and the fabric didn\\'t make me itch. i really liked the unique look to the shirt. For reference: 5\\'3, 130#, athletic/muscular body type (broad shoulders, slim hips)\\r\\ni bought my usual size 4 and it fit perfectly. like other reviewers said, this is a very fine corduroy fabric. the thicker fabric really helps smooth any bumps and bulges, and the a-line skirt was flattering. overall i liked this dress, but the color didn\\'t do much for me. because it just wasn\\'t \"wow\" on me, i found little things to nitpick. the bodice is very flattering, but the way it cuts in shows bra-straps ( I anticipated receiving this skirt as i love a longer pencil skirt and this looks beautiful. i opened it, tried it on, sent it back...it is well made but has too many negatives. first, it is very thick. i ordered size 6 (5\\'2\", 140 lbs.). the size was good, but it is so thick that it adds lots of extra fluff around the waist and abdomen. it is also very stretchy and fits in an unflattering way. finally, and most importantly, it has a back and front vent and both are vented all the way up to the c I ordered an xxs online and it\\'s still massive. the only thing i can use it for is a beach coverup. the embroidery is pretty but i will be returning. I received this jacket in the mail today. i wasn\\'t sure of my size so i ordered the s & m. i opened the medium first and found that to fit me well. i never tried the small on. fyi, i am 5\\'5\", 125 lbs. & 34a in the chest. it allowed some \"give\" room for layering, like the picture of the model. this is a very cute jacket, no doubt about it. i like the combo of the linen with the leather. the outside of the jacket is well constructed. the reason i put 4 stars and said \"but\" is because of the unfini This top was just not flattering. i\\'m 5\\'8\" and medium build, and the m was very bulky and the fabric didn\\'t fall in the right places. made me look very round and i\\'m not, so it\\'s definitely going back! This is so much nicer in person! wore this out today...now that it isn\\'t too too cold. fashionable and warm. love the clasp. quite genius! i am a 36c and while i\\'d normally take a small, got this in medium and it fits perfectly. i\\'d say this piece runs slightly small for retailer. I am on the fence about this dress. the fabric is gorgeous and soft. however, i was hoping the fit was more slouchy like pictures on the model. it was much shorter on me that pictured (for reference i am 5\\'7) and the turtle neck part of the dress is kind of high and tight. i wanted to love this so much, but it is a touch off from what i was hoping it was going to be. Very chic version of a turtleneck/tunic. material more substantial than i expected. ultimately it wasn\\'t really flattering on my body type but otherwise i would absolutely recommend. This dress is beautifully made, but it does not flair slightly as in the photo, it stick out like a tent. it might be a good maternity dress. the fabric is somewhat stiff andheavy with a slight texture. Although the material of this top is beautiful and the quality is nice as well, it really did not lay right on me. i\\'m a 34d, and i got my usual size in a small. the arm holes were a bit too big, the waist was too wide and it overall looked like a bib on me. This dress is timeless. so cute on and fits easily. i like that it has long sleeves yet it is a light fabric. comfortable and stylish. that is for me! i am taking it this weekend to nyc for a trip. i think i will fit right in! This dress looks cute online, but it is enormous. i bought a small, but it looked more like a 3x plus size. i tried it on, just in case, and honestly it looked like a great dress for a clown. this dress must have had two feet of fabric pinned behind the model in the photo. Beautiful in pictures and i loved it before i tried it on. as the other reviews state, it is short and wide. i like the top so much, i am going to try to add some gathering across the back to offer some shape. otherwise it is an unflattering shapeless box :( Bummer, i fell in absolute love with these gems until i realized how weak the stretch is by the end of the day. i purchased them on the 13th of feb and can\\'t bare to wear them anymore. Granted that i am not as reed thin, or as young, as the model. but i am tall and reasonably slender. i have long hands and small wrists, which would be a factor in the overall effect of this garment. this poncho looked like some sad old stretched out who-knows-what that you\\'d keep in the car for emergency purposes, in case you needed warmth if the car broke down in a snowstorm -- and i have one of those foldable reflective blankets in the glove box for that purpose. i was looking for a statement I love everything about this dress, but the bust area. the bottom is so light and flowey with the pleating. makes you want to twirl. the color is light but not as light as the photo. it does not wash me out. the problem is the bust. it has pleats that billow out near the armpit area, making you look top heavy. the bottom is slimming, the top make you look buxom. the v neck is also higher than i would like, which again adds to the fullness of the chest area. i am still debating keeping this or re This dress had so much potential. looked cute when i received it. put it on & couldn\\'t wait to take it off. it\\'s shapeless, top heavy & just overall unflattering. the material could be cute....on a totally different dress. don\\'t waste your money. So this dress is absolutely gorgeous! my problem is i am 5\\'10\" and it is very short wasted. between the shoulders and waist and even the arm holes it just plain doesn\\'t work. i think if you are taller this dress just won\\'t work. i have purchased other items from this name brand and have had the same problem. The blue is not see though at all and the length is perfect. so many tops now are on the longer side or have the high/low hems. this one is great....love it. kinda want the white one now! I love this top- it\\'s loose and flowy, yet flattering, and the colors are fun. the armholes are cut a little low, so a cami is necessary. after one wash and lay flat dry, the wrinkling is substantial. hope i can steam it back to its normal shape. I tried this dress on in a 6 and a 4 (a 4 is a little small for me but it looked so loose and flowy i thought sizing down would be a good idea). the 4 fit in the outer layer, however as the previous poster mentioned, the lining is super tight. i couldn\\'t even pull the 4 lining down over my hips. the 6 was far too big in the shoulders and arms and still too tight in the lining. not sure what when wrong here but it\\'s a shame because it\\'s a really cute dress. I feel in love with this piece. the color are gorgeous and i received so many compliments. it lifted my mood just wearing it! sadly, ut the end of the first wear i had a run up the front and by the middle of the second wear the light fabric got caught on something and a hole developed. upon further inspection i found another hole at the top where the price tag must have been attached. i also noticed all over pilling after the first wear! so sad! they should recreate this in a heavy fabric. I love the idea of this shirt, but the execution is absolutely horrible. i ordered online and what i received is just a mess. the stitching at the bottom has big globs of black thread. not just a few hanging off, but literally big clumps. a large portion of the stitching on the whole shirt looks like it should be on the underside of the shirt as the where the thread is tied off is on the outside!! the fit is just as big a mess. i always have to buy a large in fitted shirts because i have very br I have never taken the time to write a review but i was so disappointed by this dress. the design is cute and i got the medium instead of a small (i\\'m normally a 4/6) and i wanted to make sure it was a bit looser and below the knee. that was a good call because the fit is comfy and cute belted. however, it is so very thin and see through. i was looking forward to a cool, cotton dress for summer but this will definitely require a full slip if i decide to keep it. it came with no slip at all so th This blouse is so beautiful and feminine. it fits loosely and is see thru, so you do need to wear a cami underneath it. it is very comfortable to wear. i got many compliments when i wore this blouse. all the delicate lace on it just makes you feel very pretty in it. however, be extra careful when you do wear it. i\\'m still not quite sure how it happened, but the lace in the front got a small hole right in the front on my first time wearing it. it\\'s so pretty i just hope i can get it fixed so it w \"does this sweater make my hips look big?\" my wife asked. this sweater was one of my christmas gifts to this fair maiden.\\n.\\n\"no, love, it does not,\" i said, but i looked, to make sure my reflex was also correct. it\\'s a beautiful sweater for my dear bride, mother of our three children, and no, it does not make her hips look big.\\n\\nin fact, it draws out all her lovely lines and curves, just so. and she is a modest girl, so she wears a little undershirt so that her cleavage is somewhat...um...suppre I saw this vest the week it came in the store. i was hesitant, thinking, \"what do i have to go with this?\" i left the store and had to go back and purchase it. i\\'m so happy i did! it really does go well simple tops (dressy or casual). it is also perfect for the \"winter white\" trend happening this year! Literally the only reason i am giving this 4 stars is because of my history with this brand (holes developing after minimal wear). i will do my usual wash but don\\'t dry and hope it holds up!\\r\\n\\r\\nmaterial: super soft and comfortable, almost slubby. i haven\\'t seen the yellow in person, the purple/grey is lovely. \\r\\n\\r\\nfit: moderate scoop neck as pictured (almost oval) that\\'s a nice touch as it\\'s not too low or high at the neck. not overly fitted over the chest or stomach - without being oversized - j I wanted to love this dress so much but it just looked frumpy no matter what i did. i\\'m normally a 14, and i bought a size 12 and it still looks very baggy and not flattering. i\\'m sad because in photos it\\'s my favorite dress of all time! I tried this on in the store and i couldn\\'t keep it on my body for more then 30 seconds. it\\'s extremely itchy, which is a pity, because i do appreciate the design. :( I ordered this in white and it\\'s quite sheer. as others have noted, it is really full and it hits at mid-hip which doesn\\'t work on my figure. if it had been a few inches longer and more of a tunic, or less voluminous, it could have worked but nope. I was really eager to receive this sweater, i was expecting the same as in the picture. i received it today and i am already returning it. first of all the sweater didn\\'t look new, it is mostly shapeless, it has little balls and piling on the wool (what happens after wearing a sweater for a few months) and the metallic color makes it look cheap. in the knitting itself there are missing points and there are actual holes in some places. it is a beautiful design but other than that not even the col I wanted this jacket to fit on me like in the photo, but i guess my frame was still to petite. the fabric was also on the cheap end I love the design of this blouse and the pattern, but the colors are a bit darker than in the photo. the quality is pretty poor. i feel like its a snag away from being ruined and thrown away and for this price it is just not worth the purchase. sending it back :( \\r\\nit comes with a tank top; just to let others know. This could seriously fit a large and it\\'s an xs. so frustrating!! this is the fourth retailer dress that is ordered that is just enormous. i get the whole \"loose fit\" style, but seriously??? you\\'ve taken it to a whole new level, retailer!!! another trip to the store to return another item. a complete waste of my time. ugh. The top is made well and has a strap holder to keep your bra hidden which is always a nice feature. however the amount of fabric made it unflattering on me. the overall design is fun and i probably would have purchased if it had been more fitted and flattering. i have a medium on in the photo, my measurements are 38-30-40. I am 5\\'4, 34c, with a pear shape. this dress fit me perfectly in a medium (30 inch natural waist). i had to use a safety pin to keep the bosom from gaping too much, so a smaller chested person would likely not have any issues. however, the material and design were perfectly pinup and work appropriate, so i was willing to make adjustments for it. Not up to retailer standards! fabric quite thin(you could see nude-color bra through the white one) and thin fabric, wide bottom hung sloppy; no way i would feel \"well dressed\" in this top. i returned it. This top is crazy in the front and just way-off when it comes to a cross-over drape. the top did not lay flat and the drape over has one snap which seemed to \"bloop\" open constantly. the bottom in the front is a strange combination of layers that i couldn\\'t get to look good.\\n\\ni\\'m busty, but this isn\\'t the reason this blouse is just a disaster of a fit on me. the blouse fits tts and everything was covered, so it\\'s not like it was too small and tugged. that\\'s not the case. this blouse just didn\\'t Purchased the daisy sleep top to go with the matching shorts. i had been eyeing them for awhile in the store and so glad i took the plunge to get the set. i feel feminine and sexy as another reviewer noted while not being revealing (helpful for visitors and children :). i purchased a s as it does run a bit large. It\\'s true to size but as an fyi for fellow pilcro high rise wearers, don\\'t size down like you might with them. i had my regular and my high rise pilcro sizes and my regular size fit in these. the down side for these is they are clingy and a bit prone to a camel toe effect until they stretch out during the day Love this skirt. super comfortable, yet nicely tailored. roomy pockets always come in handy. the dark mustard looks great with the black and white tops that dominate my closet. this will be my go-to skirt for the fall for both my business-casual office environment and weekends out and about running errands, etc. i agree with the other reviewers re: sizing: because of the stretch, if you?re between sizes, you should size down. i\\'m usually a medium, or size 8 or 10, so i got the 8. i may have been Retailer consistently provides unique, sophisticated and quality made clothing. with the exception of an occasional purchase at their sister companies, i shop with them exclusively. i suppose that i can\\'t expect 100% perfection from retailer-but 99% of the time-that\\'s what i get. this is that 1%...this sweater is truly awful! i cannot (or find it very difficult at least) begin to describe what this sweater is like but it is so unlike retailer that, had it not been for the distinct pattern on the front Soft cotton in very stylish yet simple style. regrettably, i listened to reviews that said it ran tts and ended up w a baggy long one that won\\'t work even if i shrink it. that will teach me-- always order multiple sizes! When i tried this top on, i started laughing. the two rows of ruffles are made of a starchy thick cotton, which, instead of falling by the hips, juts out like wings. it\\'s also huge. cute idea, wrong material and placement. Based on some reviews i decided to get the regular xs, even tho i am an xs petite (5\\'2, 107 lb, 32c) i found the fit to be flattering -- fitted enough but not too loose or tight. the length is perfect and work appropriate, and the material has some weight to it. the grey one is colorful and cute. the only problem is the bagginess of the arms -- very unflattering. if i push the sleeves up, it hides the bagginess a little, but i would like to have the option to wear the dress with long sleeves., s Recommend this vest - nice design - fabric is thicker than expected - might suggest a size smaller - plenty of room in loose styling The print is very pretty but the fabric is stiff and it runs way too big.  looks great on the model but awful on me. For a special occasion, but i didn\\'t keep mine:\\r\\n\\r\\ni ordered petite and it was short on me, too short for my comfort \\r\\ncolor is nice, rsty burgundy, i expected it a little more \\'red\"\\r\\nfastening is a little more complicated, though you don\\'t have to make it complicated, it has hooks at each end of the hole in the back,.\\r\\n\\r\\nbut: it is a nice cut, flattering to the silhouette, i might order a regualr size if i needed it. the body is structured, mateiral is not stiff, but also not soft. the arms is Very comfortable and flattering top, but runs a bit large. i am usually a medium and fit comfortably into the small. the blue stripes are not see through, however i saw  the black motif in stores and it\\'s definitely see through. I loved the idea of this dress and was hoping it would be worth the astronomical price tag for what really is a cotton jersey dress. unfortunately, this dress missed the mark. in the pictures this dress looks like the fabrics are navy blue and some sort of white. well, it is not white or whitish at all but baby pink! bright baby pink! even the light pattern on the navy background is actually pink. huge disappointment. my other issue is with the length of this dress. the description says that the My usual size was a bit large and baggy in most areas but the bust was sooo soo small. the button popped and i had barely moved. do not recommend this one for anyone with a bust. the detailing is very pretty though for someone that can make this work. I love the top for its minimal fuss - no ironing, yay! definitely go 1 size smaller than your regular size. i got my usual small size but was swimming in it at the waist. the pattern and material are great! i bought the navy blue and might also get the yellow. i would have liked it to be slightly longer, since i have a curvy bottom. i am 140lbs and got the small. Love this shirt. i have it in black.  i have a larger chest, but i don\\'t feel like the seams hit me wrong.  this is super cute and swingy.  i however think the price is way too high for a think cotton tee. I\\'m 5\\'6\\'\\' , athletic build-thought it was cute but in the end didn\\'t like the color of the inner sweatshirt--wish it was black or white. send it back. I purchased this and another eva franco dress during retailer\\'s recent 20% off sale. i was looking for dresses that were work appropriate, but that would also transition well to happy hour or date night. they both seemed to be just what i was looking for. i ordered a 4 regular and a 6 regular, as i am usually in between sizes. the 4 was definitely too small. the 6 fit, technically, but was very ill fitting. not only is the dress itself short, but it is very short-waisted. i am only 5\\'3\", but it fe This is a lovely embroidered (hard to see in the pictures) shift that i purchased to wear to a fancy fundraiser. it has vintage \\'60s lines that are fun. very forgiving fit. i am 5\\'5\" 125 lbs with a 32dd bust and purchased a 4 petite (for a great price!!!). i might alter it so it has a bit of a waist curve, but that is minor. Love these jeans as they look great with dress shoes, running shoes or boots. fit well and true to size. The high neck and \"square-ness\" did not work for me .. but might for someone else. I really wanted to like this shirt, but it made me look 9 months pregnant. which would be fine if i were pregnant.  it sits wired in the bust and flows out in the front and back. not flattering at all. Beware! there is a reason this sweater is on sale. it is not even remotely the same color as pictured. instead of the lovely antique blue in the photo, this sweater is a faded, boring, teal-green. what a huge disappointment. The color is a very soft peach, and the knit top over the gauze is a very light, summer-weight knit. i can see this being worn casual, or dressed up with a statement necklace and nice skirt / pants. I am a 34dd so i purchased the small in green, hoping for a more fitted silhouette. i got what i wanted and it looked great overall. except for the chest. it just sort of mashed my chest down in a very unflattering way. but despite all that i almost kept the coat because it was so soft and warm and beautiful. and sturdy! i could have sized up for a better fit in the chest but then it would have been boxy and we hourglass shaped ladies know how poorly that works out. wish this would have worked b I went to the retailer store to look for an outfit for a wedding. i tried on a lot of dresses and the staff was super helpful with pulling items and making recommendations. after trying on their pulls, i browsed the store for myself and found this skirt. it wasn\\'t in my size but i tried it on anyway and paired it with several different tops recommended by staff. this skirt looks great with every top-black, cream, white, long sleeve, no sleeve, short sleeve. i thought i had to get it for the versat This dress is one of my new favorites. i usually wear a medium petite but had to size down in order to get it to fit properly. i was able to get the green one, while visiting in san francisco. i wish more stores had a petite section! it was great to be able to try things on!!! We always hope that the dress looks just like it is pictured i would say that this dress is more of an emerald green rather then a paler mint green . that said it is very forgiving stylewise because it does not cling and show your lumps and bumps . however the material is very thin like a sheet. length is good it is right to the knee on my 5\\'3\" frame. armholes are well positioned and not too big as to show bra or undergarments .\\r\\n not so sure how it would hold up over an evening or afternoon wea This sweater was a big let down. i am 5\\'2\" so i ordered it in a petite. it was so short that if i lifted my arms, you\\'d see my bra!! there is no way i could wear it without something under it- even with high waisted bottoms. and the bell sleeves look nothing like the pic. the entire sleeve is just wide, and it continues with little increase into the cuff. it is just short and boxy. it is going back for sure. Really liked the styling on this jumpsuit. it looks great on, the lattice back is unusual. i had been looking for a little black jumpsuit for the longest time and this fits the bill. just wish the fabric wasn\\'t polyester. on the down side the top buttons are really hard to put on and take off. if you take care of your nails, it could do a number on them. the bottom buttons are easier. can only imagine a struggle when trying to take this off in an emergency bathroom break! This is a cute, flattering dress, however the drop-waist, the short length and the odd-length sleeves (shorter than shown in the photos!!!) added up to me feeling like i was dressing way to young. it just didn\\'t convey an elegant, mature vibe. this dress is perfect for a 20s-30s woman who wants a versatile dress to wear on many occasions. it\\'s great because it\\'s not too expensive and you could wear it with any type of shoes.\\r\\n\\r\\nmy big problem is the lack of transparency regarding the actual slee It\\'s pretty, floaty, feminine; the photos don\\'t do justice to the prettiness. but the photos also don\\'t show an asymmetrical hem. i understood it runs small so i got two sizes, to be safe, and even my larger size was strangely short-waisted, and i\\'m short-waisted to start with. maybe i could\\'ve lived with that, but both the dresses i received have an uneven hem unlike any i\\'ve ever worn or seen before. it\\'s not longer on just the sides; the hem is longer in one spot on the front, and one in the I really love this skirt. when i first tried it on, i felt as if it was too thick and bulky for my frame (i\\'m very slim), but my mom convinced me to get it. well, mother knows best! i wore it to church with boots and a blouse, and it looked great. i received endless compliments! it\\'s also a modest, yet fashionable length. This dress has so much potential but doesn\\'t make it.\\r\\ni read all the reviews and very few were favorable and still took my chances. fabric color and textures is great but the design is really off.\\r\\nwith the little folds on the shoulder and since the fabric is more on the thick side, all this make it to accumulate the \"extra\" weight on the front of the body and as result \"not flattering\" for the majority of ladies including me\\r\\nit is a shame since it has may great features, the style: flowy, low The red detail at the shoulders is pretty, and i liked the contrast between the red and white. the fabric is soft and comfortable. it is a sweater knit fabric, more substantial than you might guess from photos. the sleeve ruffles were a little poofy for me, and combined with the loose fit it made me feel a little too girl-ish. this could work for you if you are looking for a peasant style blouse with a forgiving shape and nice details, but it wasn\\'t quite right for me. I wanted to love this set, but sadly it just didn\\'t fit as i had hoped. the small was bigger than expected and looked frumpy and not sexy. returned. As another reviewer pointed out, although the tag inside the dress says that you can machine wash in cold water, the color around the popsicles will bleed! this is extremely disappointing. i\\'m hoping it can either be fixed with dye remover, or that retailer will take this item back. would only dry clean this item. I ordered this dress, expecting a cool lightweight summer dress. i believe it says cotton in the description.however the material is a very heavy cotton-linen blend.would have much preferred a better quality fabric.the color is a nice green and is well made.it runs large, except in the bust which fit well. I wanted to love this sweater but the fit is just awkward. it is very short and box and ends up being very short in the back. i am going to return this item. On a positive note the dress was very well made, great quality as usual from retailer. however. this dress looked like a sack, i believe it may have been the combination of the drab color and the sack like shape. very plain and unflattering. for reference i am 5 5 140lbs 34c ...so i do have a shape it just did nothing for me. it had to go back. The dress arrived with two large buttons missing from the front complete with unraveling threads. the rest of the buttons are sewn on loosely, and in general, it\\'s poor quality. ridiculous considering the price, very disappointed. This dress (i ordered the ivory) is stunning. it is fully lined, the belt adds a needed accent, and the print on the fabric is gorgeous. the fit, though, is another issue. i typically wear a 2-4 depending on the cut and fabric of dresses, and am pretty proportionate with my hips/bust. i ordered a 2 in this dress. it was enormous on the top and painfully tight on my hips and thighs. the fabric has absolutely no give - it needs to drape perfect or it looks awful. if you have any type of hip, thigh So much extra fabric. not something i would recommend buying online. Loved the idea of this but content felt too thin and sheer. This dress is a nice twist on a luncheon/work dress. can pair with blazer or sweater, and it looks really cute with hair styled up - almost throwback.\\r\\n\\r\\nzipper sometimes gets a little caught on the lace top, but overall i\\'m really happy with this dress! An awful dress! retailer why didn\\'t you post my last review. i would not even give it a quarter of a star. This is literally the most unflattering thing i have ever tried on from retailer. the sleeves are so weird and ugly. they get really fat at the top, like a dolman sleeve, but it looks really strange because they don?t flow into the rest of the top, which is very structured. it made my shoulders look huge even though i have very narrow shoulders. this is not apparent in the model picture at all. the thick black seams at the shoulders are also placed in a really awkward spot which also contri This would be perfect except for the ridiculous attached scarf. the material is so soft and luxe. the colors are richer in person and perfectly go with everything. but the attached scarf ruins everything!! the scarf is not flattering and takes away form the cute buttons on the front. if the scarf could be removed it would be a great sweater coat. so disappointing. This was a splurge piece for my fall wardrobe. however, i will be returning it. it\\'s extremely heavy and bulky. the collar doesn\\'t lay right--it\\'s tall so it wants to flop over but it\\'s too bulky to fold and stay down. i went a size down and the sleeves are huge--wide and too long. it\\'s not flattering on my figure--i have a booty but the sweater doesn\\'t show curves at all. i also thought the colors were dingy, not bright like the photo. i think it would look good on someone tall and slender (als I would really like this dress if the material were a little thicker. it\\'s really thin so you can see my nipples straight through the dress. you can\\'t wear a bra with it because it is backless so i don\\'t understand how you are supposed to wear this outside of the house. I think this is going to be a love or hate top. i love it. it is see through, requiring an under top. however, the fabric is extremely light weight and the style is floaty so a simple lightweight tank/cami will look pretty showing through in a number of colors. i bought the off-white. it is meant to be a full fit but i think going down one size will help especially since the photos don\\'t show just how full the back really is. the fabric will probably snag easily. still i just really like the sty This top is so lovely, but runs soo big. i ordered it online and was so surprised when i tried it on at home. i\\'m normally a size 14, and i was positively swimming in this top. hoping to exchange for a petite sm. I am returning the dress. it has too much volume and is not flattering at all I love this top. the quality is excellent. the blouse is lined and falls nicely.. i like to wear it with a pair of dark gray jeans. the color is described as \"orange\", but it really has more of a bronze tone. looks very rich and exotic. it\\'s perfect top when you want to wear jeans, but want to dress it up a bit. I ordered this in xs and it fits loosely (i am 5\\'3\" and about 120 lbs). this looks great with skinny jeans or leggings and shows off the long necklaces that are in style right now. the chiffon doesn\\'t lie perfectly along the side seam, but i\\'m sure only i notice. I wanted this dress so much, i ordered it twice. both times the zipper was defective--it would get stuck midway up, at the waistline--so i had to send it back (there isn\\'t an retailer in my area). this is a shame because it\\'s got great colors and looks flattering on, and i was looking forward to pairing it with a cardigan/boots for fall. i even thought about taking it to a seamstress to have the zipper replaced, but the cost didn\\'t seem worth it. too bad, as it seems like it would be a nice The quality of the fabric these are made from is wonderful- they are soft yet structured and i was so bummed they didn\\'t fit me. i usually wear a size 28 in premium denim so i ordered a 28 and i could barely pull these up over my hips. once i pulled them on i was about 1-2 inches from being able to zip them closed. the pants fit in the legs but they were very close-fitting, which is not the look i\\'m going for. i am 5\\'5\" and was worried they would look too long since usually pants are for me, but The skirt is lovely, has beautiful colors , and the touch of lace takes it to that ultra feminine level. it\\'s a lot of skirt---yards of material and i like that it is fully lined, but this creates a problem, the source of the only negative thing i have to say about it. the only criticism i have is with the waistband---it\\'s much too flimsy to stay up on the waist because of the weight of the skirt. i had my seamstress add a heavier weight elastic band inside the one it has or the skirt would star I purchased this dress yesterday and it\\'s cute and fits great, but the embroidery across the back ripped as soon as i moved my arms. it\\'s really delicate and strains anytime you lift your arms overhead or forward. i\\'m keeping it anyway because the supersoft pretty slip that come with it is worth the sale price. Nice dress, you can wash it, i got black in med. i am 8-10 in tops and it is perfect, \\r\\nbrand new is beautiful not sure how it will look after wash. great design. i wish it would be lighter material. \\r\\nmaterial is very thick and heavy for a short sleeve dress. probably will stretch when you sit in car driving. \\r\\ni will be returning it for that reason, too heavy for summer . I knew that the cut of this shirt was boxy, but this is huge.  i wear a l or xl at retailer, and i got the m/l and was swimming in this top.  sadly, this will be going back. Looks great, the material feels great but when i put this dress on for the first time today it fell apart at the seams in the rib cage area. total disappointment! i had purchased this on sale for my graduation and was getting ready to walk out the door when i saw two holes on each side! I returned this as it was way too boxy/loose. ordered a size small but probably needed to size down. The blue has three colors of stripes: blue, white and black 9between white and blue). the black stripe made it too busy for me. the material is soft and clingy. i followed the advice of previous reviewer and sized up to a m (normally wear s). the shirt fit as pictured on the model, not tight but form fitting. I\\'m a petite so as usual i have to order from retailer. i saw this on line and tried it on in a regular size in the store. even though of course it didnt fit, the style of the tee was nice so i ordered it. i couldnt have been more disappointed when i received it. the quality was truly awful. i\\'m not even sure why it is being sold. the neckline was warped and wouldn\\'t lie flat again the neck or chest; the bottom hem was crooked. it was really bad. also having purchased tees in similar material befo The dress ran big but is tight at the bust, material is sooo sheer and the shape of the dress is off. you can\\'t see the ruffle/ flounce that runs the bottom of the dress. I loved these pants the minute i put them on, and was so happy i\\'d ordered them. but i wore them only 3 times - and only at dinners with friends, not even for full days - and the seams on both legs ripped open! i think the faux leather just isn\\'t equipped to handle the stretch of fitted leggings. i was super-bummed about this, because these pants are so insanely cute. but if they can\\'t hold up to a few casual wears, then there\\'s just no way... thankfully retailer was true to their brilliant custom It is a shame when a product such as this is left on the website after so many comments reveal the item to be more defective in production than an opinion of size proportion. i read the reviews so had expected the item to run small so i ordered accordingly...this does not run small-this is not representative of any of the three categories one associates with women\\'s apparel sizing. i am usually a small and the description by previous reviewers described the fit as being perfect for me-very small I\\'m 5\\'1\" and this top was too long for me. it\\'s pretty but expensive for what it is. I ordered the in the emerald green and it was sent to me with a dime size hole in the sleeve. i am very disappointed, because i love the sweater. by the time it arrived, it was sold out in my size. now, i cannot exchange it for one that is not damaged. if the sweater was not damaged, i would recommend this product. I wanted to love this, but instead of being a flowy kimono top as pictured- it was a thick blazer type garment. not at all what is pictured here unfortunately. also it was much shorter than pictured and i am only 5\\'4\\'\\'. \\r\\n\\r\\nlove most retailer styles, but this one was a miss and a return. I wanted to like this romper, it is very cute and colorful, but to top was overywhelming for my size and made me look even shorter. I bought the blue in store and loved it so much that my hubby recommended i buy the raspberry online! i usually buy a medium in tops, but went with the small so it wouldn\\'t be so flowy. fabric is soft and not itchy. i will be wearing these a lot this fall! Yikes. there is a whole lot of skirt here. i am 5\"4, weigh around 120 lb, and usually wear anywhere between a four and six in retailer clothing, depending on the designer. this skirt balloons out from the waist. on the website it seems to flow more naturally from the waist. i think that the flowers are cute but the material is cheap looking. the skirt is very long- hitting way below mid-calf. there is also tons of material - creating a parachute effect. definitely returning. I bought the umbrella print in the petite length. i\\'m pleased with the whimsical print and crisp colors. the fit is just right for me, although the style runs a bit wide at the waist. it\\'s a casual loose fit, more fitted on top at the bust, shoulders and sleeves, and flaring out below the waist. i would wear it untucked over jeans or a narrow skirt. the only thing i\\'m not crazy about is the rayon fabric, though it is a substantial weight and machine washable. This sweater is a dull off white color. it looks old fashioned. don\\'t get. I ordered a size xl. it\\'s flowy so it could be running larger but since the fit in the shoulders/neck/sleeves matches the model, i think it\\'s true-to-size for the design. it is so comfortable. i love the softness of the material. the problem for me is the color. on my monitor, it looks like a light ivory or white. but, the embroidered lace bib portion is a darker ivory shade that doesn\\'t work for my complexion so i\\'ll be returning mine. everything is well-made though, especially the vintage-styl I am obsessed with denim and have two other pairs of ag jeans from retailer that i am very happy with. my recent preference has been for high-rise skinny jeans and decided to give these a try because of the versatile medium wash. when i tried these on in my normal size, they were so cute that i bought them full-priced. i could tell that the material was pretty stretchy (which is what makes them soft and comfortable), but was not expecting them to stretch out and sag after a few hours. by th I love the color and the cut! it fits well and i have a large bust. hangs very pretty. I ordered the copper in a medium which i felt was tts (5\\'4\" 145). the color is beautiful and i love the buttons on the shoulders which i really didn\\'t notice in the picture, the material is also very soft. but i have some complaints.. first i felt that the material, while soft, was not very substantial for the price. i purchased another vest from that store that has everything which was $100 less and seems to be the same quality. i also was expecting there to be some way to close the vest beside I tried wearing it, however, i thought i needed courage to wear this tank.\\r\\nunfortunately, i did not purchase this tank although i liked color and design.\\r\\nfirst, it runs small than the regular size. \\r\\nit feels even smaller because my size is xs.\\r\\nin addition, it tends to exaggerate a body line.\\r\\ni am not quite sure why this happens, but maybe it is just the way this tank is.\\r\\nif you are confident about your upper body posture, then yes, it would look very cool.\\r\\nhowever, if you have thin postur Although the material of this top is beautiful and the quality is nice as well, it really did not lay right on me. i\\'m a 34d, and i got my usual size in a small. the arm holes were a bit too big, the waist was too wide and it overall looked like a bib on me. Cute little dress fits tts. it is a little high waisted. good length for my 5\\'9 height. i like the dress, i\\'m just not in love with it. i dont think it looks or feels cheap. it appears just as pictured. This is exactly the same cut as the breton peasant blouse, which i also ordered. it\\'s extremely tight thru the bust and the sleeves are very wide at the top which adds width to the look of this blouse. it added 20 pounds! the print is beautiful. the ruffles are trimmed with a golden colored thread which is a beautiful detail. i ordered size large and am well endowed. steer clear if you have a bust. The beadwork is gorgeous, but the sleeves are so puffy, it looks as though you\\'re wearing shoulder pads. the fabric of the shirt isn\\'t that fabulous either. I loved this shirt and attempted to buy it - however the armhole is so small i couldn\\'t barely get the shirt off and almost had to call someone into the dressing room to pull it off of me. i\\'m usually a 6 and i tried on the 6 and 8, and both shirts had the same problem. it wasn\\'t exactly the sleeve that was too tight, but the arm hole that was not big enough. it pulled across the top of my chest and was not roomy enough to slip in and out of. which was odd because the rest of shirt was fine. i d These pants fit great!! i ordered my normal medium and they fit perfectly. i was worried that they may look too much like pajamas and lot look right with my stomach but no issues there. i think i will get a lot of use out of these! On a hot summer 90 degree day the blue ink on the dress stained the dress and my new tory burch bag. i would never have expected that the blue print would bleed all over me and my new dress. great dress and such a wonderful fit...too bad its unwearable now. I saw this dress in the catalog and had to have it. when i went to the store it was sold out so i had them order and ship it to me in two sizes - my regular and one size larger. when i got them, i tried on my regular size first and it was just perfect! beautiful pattern and material. light and airy. sexy with the low-cut \"keyhole.\" i am sooo happy with my purchase. I\\'m so upset that this didn\\'t work out. i\\'m petite at 5\\'2 and ordered this skirt in petite, however, i felt like it swallowed me up. the fabric is thick and warm so this is definitely only cold weather attire. i\\'m the picture it looks like there is a little leg showing, but on me, i feel like a schoolmarm. sadly, this is going back. Cute top but started disintegrating after two washes. the delicate cutouts in the top tore apart. i machine washed it in the gentle cycle and didn\\'t use the dryer. disappointed to have to discard the top after just buying it. Love these.  i bought the grey which is a grey/taupe/light olive chameleon.  totally depends upon what i wear with them.  the rolled up cuff is adorable and the material is perfect.  the fit is true to size - tight but not restrictive.  comfy all day long.   and best of all, they don\\'t stretch out over the day.   i\\'m 5\\'10, a size 6 normally and a size 28 fit me perfectly. I love the metallic colors of this top and figured i could wear it under a ruched jacket and circle skirt for work. welp, that\\'s out the window. this design is poor. for one, this is not a piece for a petite woman with no torso and i don\\'t know how anyone with a longer torso wears t his. this hits above my belly botton on and i got apetite 2. i have no torso. so, without a jacket, i would never wear this. it\\'s very low cut..the back is very low..it\\'s a little loose but i run between a 2 and a 4. I absolutely adore this set. it\\'s beautifully constructed-- perfect for something special but comfortable enough for everyday wear. i normally wear a 32 c but got the 34 a/b and it fits perfectly. my only complaint is that the longline portion tends to ride up and rest just below the underwire, as there is no band holding the lace in place along the bottom. still, it is far and away my favourite bra and i highly recommend it. Love this dress! the embroidery is stunning and adds to each detail of the dress. i love the pink undertone. it is subtle. it makes it more unique. this is why i love online exclusives. they have that \"one of a kind\" look to them. the quality is great and the style is that there really is no shape to it. it has a nice everyday feel, but along with its elegance, can easily be dressed up as well. priced a little high is my only complaint. Great color and fit and feminine This is a very pretty dress with a unique bodice and neckline. however, it seems to run small on top. i can not zip up the top by myself (zipper is in the back) even though i usually wear a size 2 or xs in this brand (i\\'m a 32d so i\\'m narrow on top). i haven\\'t decided yet if i\\'m keeping it because despite the sizing issue, the dress is lovely! I really love the fit of this dress. i said it runs true to size, and it really does--even with the stretch fabric around the back and adjustable straps, i would not recommend sizing down as i normally do at retailer--there is no stretch to the actual fabric on the dress. i\\'d never bought anything by this brand before, and i would say that the fabric is quite thin for the price of the dress, and it is not lined (i\\'m still hoping it\\'s not see through). however, for me, the style makes up for Was really excited for this dress but should have paid more attention to the material it was made with. for the price of the dress, it felt very cheap. i didn\\'t even end up trying it on after i opened the packaging. the colors were not as vibrant as the picture. as another reviewer mentioned, it was more similar to something you would purchase off a boardwalk. very disappointed and will be returning. It\\'s a cute idea, but it\\'s so low cut and the material is very thin. i was hoping to wear it as a cool, flowing summer top, but i\\'ll have to layer it since my whole bra basically hangs out of it. i\\'m only keeping it because it was such a good price. also the buttons are super tiny and a little hard to fasten. I purchased this item in the gray heather color and loved it so much i wanted to buy every other color. the fabric was cottony and felt very soft and cushy against my skin, and the gray color was from the combination of black and white fibers. i ordered the light gray and the red online and could not wait for them to arrive. but the other colors were not even in the same material, but a very shiny and synthetic feeling fabric, with just a single color weave that did not have the same feel or tex This shirt was so weird?it does not fit like the photo at all. there seems to be missing a stitch or something at the top as it is wide open until the bottom/where it meets the other layer. i could wear a tank/camisole underneath, but it still just did not fit right. i do not have a large chest, but this was ridiculous. beyond that, the red color was just okay. even though i purchased this on sale, it was not worth the price and i returned. First of all, this is not pullover styling. there is a side zipper. i wouldn\\'t have purchased it if i knew there was a side zipper because i have a large bust and side zippers are next to impossible for me.\\n\\nsecond of all, the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath.\\n\\nnot at all what is looks like or is described as. sadly will be returning, but i\\'m sure i will find something to exchange it for! I purchased these in a 26 petite and a 26 regular. the 26r was too long and bunched up terribly pass the knee. they were also loose in the waist and overall body. the 26p fit great in the waist and body, however; past the knee it was too tight and again it bunched but not as bad as the 26 reg. the overall quality of the jean seems fairly good. the fit just did not work for me so these go back and the hunt continues for white jeans. would love it if they made the hyphen jeans in white. I love these jeans, but they run small. i recommend ordering one size up. If you are going for a ridiculously high priced ugly sweater contest, this is the one for you. i normally like clothing with some character and juxtaposition, but this one did not do it for me. i cannot imagine the collar fitting right or flattering anyone, and the mixed layers end up making it look cheap rather than trendy. I have featured photos below. i\\'m 5 feet and 120 lbs and 34 d. i purchased a small petite. the fabric is cotton, i thought it would be rayon. it is lined with cotton fabric. the skirt has major poof. it falls like a midi on a petite. the waist runs high, which can not be a  good thing for a busty gal. why do i love it? the pattern is one of a kind. the colors are so fall. i wore a vest to accomplish a tapered look. i can\\'t resist this skirt. if your tall, this is a dream. if your petite, you can I really like this jacket! it runs big, so you may want to size down. the fabric was softer than i was expecting, but i really like it. very cute fall jacket! This dress is so well made, but it\\'s a lot of dress. i think i would have liked it if it were shorter. it felt a little too 50s housewife to me, and i was hoping for a flowing material. it wasn\\'t worth the price to me so i sent it back. I love how comfortable this dress is, it does run a little large so i would order a size down. i\\'m 5\\'3\" and around 125lbs and had to exchange the xsp for an xxsp. This top is exactly what i was hoping for except it is missing the drawstring. so disappointing, mailing it back. The stylist had me try this top on off the shoulders, but that was kind of snug, perhaps why it didn\\'t fit right, it is not off the shoulders on this picture. the cut is loose, so it looked big on me, but going smaller would not have worked the way i had it on... may give it another try on. xs was big, so would need to try the xxs next time. but off the shoulders looked nice on the lady who was smaller built next to me!\\r\\n\\r\\ncolors are nice, light, but appropriate for fall (or summer!) light fabri I am 5\\' 7\" - 110 lbs. ordered my normal xs and the bottom portion was way over sized. it fit like a parachute, you could fit about 12 of me in the bottoms and very short. nice quality material, but extremely awkward fit. I\\'m upset because for the price of the dress, i thought it was embroidered! no, that is a print on the fabric. i think i cried a little when i opened the box. it is still ver pretty. i would say it is true to size, it is a tad bit big on me, but i am very tiny, but i can still get away with it. the color is vibrant. the style is unique. skirt portion is pretty poofy. i keep going back and forth on it mainly because of the price, although the quality is definitely there. except i wish it were emb I purchased this top in the black and tan color, loved the fit, style and fabric. however, it is a loose weave and after just one wearing a hole opened up on the front, which could not be repaired. it was covered by the cowl neck collar but as the day wore on the hole got bagger and it can no longer be hidden. i was very disappointed in the quality of this top- i purchased it at full price and was only able to wear it once. i just didn\\'t have the time to return it to the store. I had reservations about this top based on other reviews, but it looked cute on the model so i took my chances. i have an athletic build--not model-thin, but not dumpy either--and this top made me look very frumpy and matronly. the sleeves were especially unflattering. i purchased it in an ps and might have done better with a pxs. I saw army green pants similar to this in the store, but then found these on line and ordered them instead. i love them. they stretch out a bit so i am glad i sized down. i could possibly have sized down even one more size. i got a 27. the waist is very comfortable, so maybe this is just the fit...after all, they are basically stylish fatiques. either way, they are casual but on trend. i have planned a ton of outfits in my head already because these pants will go with so much! i think the cuff w Love this dress. in fact, i loved it enough to get it altered so it would fit. purchased the black dress in a size 6, but the top was too big. and i\\'m not small chested, i am a 32d! i had to get the seam under my underarms taken in for the top of the dress to fit properly. but, now that it is altered...i love it. I loved the design of this suit. the zigzag pattern is great at covering up any tummy issues but the print is still fun and not frumpy. i got a compliment the first day i wore it. it is a great one piece that gives great coverage and yet is still fun. the only thing i don\\'t like about the suit is that the top of the suit slips over showing the lining. i read this in other reviews and it is true. while that is annoying, i liked the suit enough to keep it. I generally don\\'t write bad reviews, but there is a real discrepancy between the quality of this kimono and the cost. the design and colors are great, but the fabric is ripping on all the kimonos on the rack in my store where the manufacturer\\'s tag is at the back of the neck. the material is very thin, so there are other small holes beginning throughout the garment. i shop at retailer all the time, and this is not a $98 item of clothing. Very disappointed. ordered two sizes, the fraying of the embroidery was so bad on one of the dresses i wouldn\\'t have worn it and the zipper was sticking. the second dress had fraying and loose threads as well and the seams at the shoulders were not properly sewn which made the lace at the neckline completely crooked. some of these issues would maybe be acceptable if the dress was under $100 but at $228 they are not. returning both sizes. The \"movement\" in these culottes when i walk makes me feel like i should have some, \"yeah, i can wear these attitude!\" not only is the quality exceptional but the fabric is \"thick\" enough to hide flaws. i am 5\\' 120 lbs and i ordered the 4petite. i am usually a 6petite. the size 4p fits perfectly. i ordered the apricot color. great neutral. i\\'m so happy i was able to get a pair -there\\'s a reason most sizes are sold out! i have short legs, and my legs are medium in size. i worried about the thigh Lovely knit and so soft, but the bottom curls up underneath, similar to the bell sleeves. runs oversize too, got xs and it\\'s too bulky and unflattering since the bottom doesn\\'t lay flat. returned! So cute! i get tons of compliments whenever i wear it. very comfortable. i ordered a petite l and it\\'s a little big. i usually buy the petite m, but due to the under slip i wasn\\'t sure. This is a cute dress, but the buttons are tiny and the top one cracked in half before i could even put the dress on. i can\\'t risk the buttons breaking off while i am wearing it. especially since the dress seems designed for an a cup, anything larger will be more than those little fragile buttons can handle. I ordered this in cream during the 25% sale. i had seen one at the store and thought it was very pretty, but it was not my size, so i didn\\'t try it on. when it arrived, it was a wrinkled mess. it was so wrinkled that i don\\'t think i would be able to iron it satisfactorily. i was also disappointed in the fabric of the dress layer. it almost looked flocked and i wonder if something is wrong with this dress in particular. it was also way too short for me. i\\'ll be taking it back very soon. i do plan I agree with the other review that the dress runs big and long, but i love it! it\\'s very flattering and i have super high wedges that work great with it. i don\\'t think it runs \"super big\" but it\\'s slightly big. definitely size down if small busted. i wore it out and got a ton of compliments. it\\'s classy, different and hot! This dress looked super cute in the picture and on the model. i ordered the petite style and it was still so big and way too loose. no shape whatsoever! i unfortunately had to return it. i love loose dresses but this one was way too big, loose and had no shape at all. Runs a size big unless you want it really boxy. felt the matl was flimsy and would prob pill soon. turquoise was a pretty color but returning this one. I wanted to love this dress. i ordered online and what you cannot see in the picture if the pleating on the dress. i ordered a medium, i am usually a large in retailer and the medium looked like a tent. i realize this should be loose fitting but it was huge. Cute dress to throw on and go. fits pretty true to size except for the slip underneath. it\\'s a little tight and i felt to short for the dress. i ended up wearing a full slip i had under it and that work great! Just got this dress and am very pleased.  fell in love with the bright color in the store and then came home ordered it at a great sale price!!  color is as shown...beautiful lace trim at the bottom.....back longer than front as described and pockets!!  i am 5\\'2\" and length on a large comes to just below the knees..in front....i may wear leggings under it...dont like the slip as it is far too tight...will wear a tee or turtle under it..  quality heavier fabric. roomy... linen and cotton. I have been looking for lace shorts for years. yes, years! finally found these shorts that are perfect. the lace is sturdy, not flimsy, so they are not see-through. i purchased both the cream and the blue when they went on sale. my skin is a bit tan, so lighter-colored clothing can be see-through for me. both colors are fantastic and i get compliments on them all the time, especially the blue shorts. plus, they complement either a t-shirt or a blouse. i love the eyelash fringe at the hem - such Was really excited for this dress but should have paid more attention to the material it was made with. for the price of the dress, it felt very cheap. i didn\\'t even end up trying it on after i opened the packaging. the colors were not as vibrant as the picture. as another reviewer mentioned, it was more similar to something you would purchase off a boardwalk. very disappointed and will be returning. I ordered this since it looked so cute on the model . when i it arrived, i was excited to try it on, but when i did...blah. the color is murky and the top runs large, not to mention that the material is too heavy for a short sleeved top (plus it\\'s lined). i really wanted to like it and debated wetting it and then putting it in the dryer to shrink it a bit. in the end, i decided that it wasn\\'t worth it. too bad, as the concept was a good one. it just failed in the execution. Love this sweater but it\\'s too large. will exchange for smaller size because i really want it. This is a beautiful dress but unfortunately it is only for women who are not well endowed - it is extremely well fitted in the chest. the high waste also poufs out due to a lot of extra material and the double lining. a beautiful dress but a very very poor construction. also there are bright blue and yellow beads in the chest area that are a bizarre combo to the corals and browns of the fabric. i am normally a 4/6 at retailer and the 8 was extremely small. I ordered this blouse after it went on sale - i\\'m not typically the blouse-y type, but i thought i\\'d try it. for me, and i\\'m a pretty consistent small across brands, it was quite flowing and a little long, but that may be what someone wants. it was a little light in color to look good on me, but i think this would be really cute with dark skinny jeans - easy to dress up or down :) This dress is gorgeous, but the cut of the neck and arms is designed for girls with a slim frame only. i wish it worked? the fabric and pattern are beautiful. sad to send it back. I bought this in black last year and i love it. i also like the two prints offered here but unfortunately the matching tops aren\\'t really my style and these prints wouldn\\'t be so easy to mix and match. please offer in other solid colors! i would buy all of them, this skirt is really that fabulous. \\r\\n\\r\\nnot only does it fit well and run true to size, it also comes up a bit further than other swim skirts i have tried on, and gives a little more tummy coverage. but not too much! somehow it hits me a Like the other reviewer, i was super lucky to find this dress at my local stores. i tried both the medium and the small. usually at retailer, i wear a medium. however, this dress in a medium did not look flattering on me. it hung off my shoulders and the material was too loose in between the velvet tiers, making my bottom look bumpy. when i tried on the small, the dress fit and flattered me perfectly! by far the best dress i ever owned. i truly recommend you try this dress on before purchasing. fo This vest was of excellent weight but it had very little style. it was like a giant piece of felt was cut out with little thought to design or nuance. not for me. This dress has a beautiful fabric, i really hated to send it back. it was just so unflattering, absolutely no shape to it. i bought a 0p, i\\'m 5\\'5\" and 117lbs and it looked like a maternity dress on me. This dress is so much better in person! i got the petite size (i am 5\\'2\") and it seems to run a bit smaller than the regular size- i have a fairly large bust so i went up a size and it seems to fit perfectly. love the colors and vintage design! i can\\'t wait to wear it for a wedding i will be attending! I agree with the previous reviewer that this shirt is way to sheer at least for me. if you don\\'t mind wearing a cami under it or your bra and skin showing in the back especially, then it might be for you. i did not feel like it was very good quality either the print is really cute, but then it did not button all the way up and i like the option because i think they drape better when they have buttons to the top wether you choose to button up. This is one of the best purchases i\\'ve ever made... i have had the black for over a year, and every time i wear it, i receive so many complements. i\\'ve dressed it up with a striped scooped back shirt, or a fitted sweater, and paired it with flannel with a belt... i love it. i\\'m 6\\' ft and slender, and the xs it hits me at the perfect length just below the knee. i recently ordered the silver in a small (it\\'s a little big in the waist- but nothing a corset belt can\\'t help) for nye. love this dress! Whatever happened to sizing! pretty print and color but has enough fabric for 2 tops. it is also unlined which is not a huge issue. i wore it with a cami. the arms weren\\'t too gaping for me, thankfully. i tried to make it work with a wide belt but i will have to get it tucked on the sides. i am 140 lbs and got the small. should have gone 1 or even 2 sizes smaller. Woah, these jeans looked ridiculous on me. i felt as though it was 1987 and i was raiding my mom\\'s closet. the combination of the light wash, the crop leg and high waist with the odd stitching around the midsection make this a no. it really accentuates any pouch you may have. i was looking for a high waisted denim but these are very unflattering. i am 5\\'3\" / 140 curvy. no, no, no! This jacket is just too small for me anyway and i am no way big. i am tall and athletic and this thing looked like it had shrunk in the wash. there are so many better fitting other types out there, this went back I have a few of these tees in the short sleeve version and found myself wearing them pretty often so i jumped on the long sleeve option when it went on sale. i bought the black and red (which is more of an orangey red). i love them as well! this top drapes nicely and has a little more style than just a plain tee. the material is thin and while that is nice for breeziness sake, i don\\'t anticipate this will last that long, but thats cool...its not a real investment piece but rather a cute casual t Wow! i saw this dress in the store and had to try it on. it is simply stunning! the bright colors and design are a true tracy reese dress and i looked like a fairy queen in it! lol. i can\\'t wait to wear it! Cute, but very itchy! have to wear a long sleeve tee underneath! I\\'m a petite so as usual i have to order from retailer. i saw this on line and tried it on in a regular size in the store. even though of course it didnt fit, the style of the tee was nice so i ordered it. i couldnt have been more disappointed when i received it. the quality was truly awful. i\\'m not even sure why it is being sold. the neckline was warped and wouldn\\'t lie flat again the neck or chest; the bottom hem was crooked. it was really bad. also having purchased tees in similar material befo It\\'s a very cute design. it looks great tucked into a cute pair of jeans, if can even be dressed up. however, i agree with the previous comments about the top not staying folded down. it likes to ride up and is difficult to keep the style like the model in the picture has. it\\'s a very cute design, it just needs to be worked with and adjusted time and time again as its worn. when it does cooperate, i\\'ve gotten many compliments on it! order a size up, i am normally a small but the medium worked be This was my go to dress this past summer. so easy to wear and pair with cute wedges. perfect to dress up or down. Purchased this in white specifically because i loved the back detail-- (i don\\'t know why most designers overlook the back??). huge disappointment-- the back is totally plain, not at all like the picture of the white top on here and the fabric in the back isn\\'t even the same material as the front. it\\'s almost as if the back is made out of leftover lining from another garment. it was a very sad return! i usually love this brand, this was just a quality control oversight i guess. Cute enough, but i couldn\\'t figure out what to do with the tie that didn\\'t make it look like an extra set of sleeves, oddly placed. Super flattering dress. love it. makes my waist look tiny. great fit and flare style without making me look pregnant! i love the fabric. will be great as a travel dress (packs easy, doesn\\'t need to be ironed really, substantial fabric). love it. i think it runs large since i\\'m rarely a 2 at retailer, but i find that maeve runs all over the place. i\\'m usually a 4 at retailer and i got a 2 in this. I wanted to love this, but instead of being a flowy kimono top as pictured- it was a thick blazer type garment. not at all what is pictured here unfortunately. also it was much shorter than pictured and i am only 5\\'4\\'\\'. \\r\\n\\r\\nlove most retailer styles, but this one was a miss and a return. Ugh! i am not sure how anyone is giving this good reviews. i tried small, medium and large on and huge huge huge, boxy, fabric bunched at the shoulders and did i mention it\\'s way too boxy? the fabric and pattern are so pretty but the fit is just awful. i would try this one on before purchasing. This is a really pretty shirt - the colors are beautiful.  it runs large, and it\\'s semi-sheer.  shape is loose and boxy, but because it\\'s more sheer, it didn\\'t seem as boxy.  i\\'m tall, and this was long enough.  only change would be to make the sleeves a little less bell like.  not tight, but lose some of the volume. This is a cute item at a good price point, though the lack of lining in cartonnier items drives me batty. unfortunately, the wool is so itchy i could not tolerate it more than a second. This is a really pretty shirt - the colors are beautiful.  it runs large, and it\\'s semi-sheer.  shape is loose and boxy, but because it\\'s more sheer, it didn\\'t seem as boxy.  i\\'m tall, and this was long enough.  only change would be to make the sleeves a little less bell like.  not tight, but lose some of the volume. The dress arrived wrinkled so i washed it and pressed it. it looked beautiful until i sat down. the entire dress was wrinkled and it looked terrible all day. can\\'t wear this again. Loved this top on model. even happier when it went on sale. sort of boxy. but still excited, then within one day there was hole already in the thin tee fabric! disappointed. my other tees i purchased are fine. This is a nice shirt, but i can\\'t keep it. i ordered a 0 and i do have an athletic build with somewhat wider shoulders given how petite i am (usually wear 00 petite in all pants) and i think this size was perfect (fit across the back perfectly) when you lift your arms the way it is cut makes it really tight across the chest and shows your stomach. at the same time, the high low styling makes for a really strange shirt-tail in the back. i\\'m sure this is the trend but it really does not look cute The neckline is very tight and itchy. the arm holes are deeply cut. the length is not as long in person as it is on the model in the picture. it\\'s short-waisted. it\\'s too bad because the embroidery is very pretty. The fit is incredible! the print is very subtle, but makes them a little bit edgy and easy to pair with many things i already have in my closet. I loved the mustard colored version of this skirt for summer and was thrilled to see it reissued in darker hues. same comfortable fit and cool textured fabric that doesn\\'t wrinkle. i found the regular sizing to still be above the knee and the wide elastic waistband great for either a cropped top or a belt. will wear often. These are very flattering thick leggings that would keep you warm in the fall and winter, but when i pulled them up i got a big hole in the seam at the waistband at my first trip to the bathroom! obviously you might expect a rip if they were too tight, but these fit perfectly (even on the looser side) and ripped effortlessly. pretty embarrassing given the price! bringing these back! \\r\\n\\r\\nfor reference ( if you decide to try your luck), i am 5\\'7\", 128# and my normal size s was perfect. I couldn\\'t even figure out how to wear this sweater the fit was so odd. the arms cut off short and the seams don\\'t hit your shoulders where they should. all the extra fabric around the collar is just confusing and unflattering. moving around in it was not easy. i will return this one! I love the fit of these pants -- they\\'re the perfect slim black pants. however, i wore these pants exactly three times before the seams split the middle of the pant in not just one, but multiple places. disappointed by the workmanship/quality of the product, especially since the pants fit amazingly and don\\'t sag like other slim fitting black pants tend to do. i hope retailer will take this into consideration and improve the quality of future iterations of this product. Absolutely love this jumpsuit. i am 5\\'2\\'\\'/103lbs and the xs fits perfectly (i am typically an xs/00). when i read previous reviews i was quite excited to read that most people found it to be \"short waisted\"-- the waist band actually hits my natural waist (just how it is pictured on the model), which never happens! great quality, thick fabric and the pleats in the front are beautiful. can\\'t wait to wear it! Love the overall design especially the tie on the back. i know it will become a favorite. i do wish it were a tad longer though. For a couple weeks, i debated making this purchase. in fear that my size would no longer be available, i ordered this lovely top. when it arrived, i was immediately disappointed with its colors...unlike the vibrant colors in the photo, the top\\'s colors were dull...more a brown than orange and gray rather than lavender. had the fit been better, i would have kept this item despite of its color. it\\'s cut weird! though it runs slightly large, i felt the top was ill fitted through the upper bust and The tank looks nothing like the one pictured, mainly because it\\'s tissue-paper thin. also, i ordered it in two sizes - xs and s as it can be hard to tell which one will fit. i started with the xs and quickly discovered that it ran large. the armholes hit halfway to my waist. obviously i didn\\'t even bother opening the size s. both will be returned. Great quality coat! very pretty colors and love the sleeves! i would have given 5 stars, but like other reviewers stated, this coat does she\\'d. best not to wear black. it is a slight \"swing\" style coat, so it\\'s not fitted at the waist and hips, but very stylish. i found it best to size down. i\\'m 5\\'4 118lb, but i\\'m large chested (32dd) i usually wear a size 6 coat or blazer so it fits my chest, but the six was too big. the size 4 fit great across my chest and still room for a sweater! This polo shirt has just the perfect amount of feminine detail to make it a great addition to my wardrobe. i love the shorter version, and it looks great with both jeans or skirts. I was disappointed with this jumpsuit. when i first saw it in the store, i thought i was going to love it. when i tried it on, the first issue is the fabric is too sheer. i could completely see the outline of my underwear and bra. it also runs way too big! i know the bottom is supposed to be loose and flowy, but the waist needs to be more tapered to off set that, and it\\'s so baggy. the arm holes are also cut very low, so when you lift your arms you can see most of your bra on the sides \\r\\ni wante I love this tee. it is light weight and fits perfectly. the additional accents like cuff work and detail around the neck makes it original. I just purchased these joggers on-line during the sale and bought them in my usual size small and they fit me tts. i\\'m 5\"4\" and just bought the regular and the length on me is perfect. these aren\\'t super thick or anything so i think they\\'ll do just fine during the spring and summer months when i just need a pair of pants to put on really quick or just to lounge around in. i find these quite comfortable and like that they have pockets too. I can\\'t get enough of this dress! this dress is everything. from the flattering fit, to the colors and pattern, to the design, and to the quality.. this dress really has it all. this is worth every penny and in my opinion, a great price for a versatile, high quality dress. the material is that super comfy, stretchy material which is perfect for everyday! it is a no brainer and easy to throw on. also, the neckline is flattering and sexy without showing \"anything\"! definitely can wear a normal bra Gorgeous embroidery, soft fabric, great drape, hides tummy--overall perfect.  size down.  i bought the small and i am 36dd. Overall, it\\'s a beautiful dress, and i really wanted it to work. but the material feels cheap (at least not what you\\'d expect for the price), and as other reviewers have mentioned, it\\'s just a tad too short. for reference, i\\'m 5\\'5, 125 lbs and the 2 fit well, but hung well above my knees. there\\'s no way i could wear this without unintentionally flashing a few people. sadly this dress will be returned. I ordered this sweater in green, and it was a lovely soft color. the style of the sweater was nice -- really deep side splits made it feel trendy. the sweater is a great length, nice fabric and the side splits are appealing. however, it was just so, so big that i couldn\\'t pull it off -- i just swam in it. i am 5\\'8\" and 118 lbs, fairly wiry?.even the xs didn\\'t work for me. perhaps it would look more suitable on a curvier woman. i even considered having it tailored, since i\\'ve had a hard time find This is really flattering. it\\'s one of the best purchases i\\'ve made through retailer. i know it will work with a lot of different body types. the medium fit me well. i bought a petite version by mistake but it still fits. For the price, you can\\'t beat this dress. i love the thicker stretchy fabric used for it - if you\\'re a fan of some of the popular maeve pencil skirts (like the tearoom pencil skirt), you will love this! for me, it\\'s the perfect piece for work with a black or white cardi or denim jacket over it. it\\'s a perfect length (above the knee on 5\"7\"...similar to the model), armholes are the right size, and the overall cut of the dress is forgiving and flattering, even post-baby. super happy with the value I love this top and the relaxed fit. can be dressed up or down. i bought the bird print and liked it so much i purchased the umbrella print. now i\\'m contemplating getting the mixed dot! easy to just throw on with anything and the mix of colors keeps it versatile too! This is a very lovely t-shirt, because of the color and design. it has a very nice shape as well as the sides are not just straight across. it\\'s perfect for leaving it untucked. the petite fits really well, no too long or too short! my only complaint is the the material, while really soft is also quite thin so i\\'m not sure how durable it is. Picked this darling vest in a medium. i have been eyeing for sometime but really did not want to pay full price, after checking other manufactures i came back to this vest at retailer. as the other reviewers mentioned, the softness, spec of colors which enables you to wear the vest with so many colors in bottoms and tops; the pockets, the belt, which i love as much as the pockets, though the faux fur collar i do wish was removable. the faux fur will limit me in getting away with wearing this vest This shirt is way too flowy and the pink color is extremely washed out- will definitely be returning! Alas, i so wanted to love this. the photos of the models wearing it look gorgeous -- flowy, drapey, ultimate grecian goddess. but it just doesn\\'t work unless you\\'re super-skinny. too much material. almost bulky; strange looking. the print is so beautiful -- i love the pink floral, and i love the whole idea of the dress. but it just doesn\\'t work. have to send it back. \\r\\n\\r\\n(i\\'m 5\\'6\", 135 pounds, 38-30-38, and i ordered a 10.) The sizing and length are great had it not been for my chest area. i sized up from my usual medium but the pleats create a maternity look for me unfortunately. it truly is a great tank top! I loved this dress and it fit perfectly. i did not have any issue with the camisole being tight, and i am really curvy. i did however have a problem trying to take it off. it has no zipper and in order for me to get it over my head i had to stretch my shoulders to the point where i ripped the back. i went to the store and tried on the larger size and ripped that one too. i tried to take it off more delicately but i couldn\\'t. maybe it was me, but this dress is too much hassle. if i went any highe This sweater was not as featured in the picture. the front is completely cropped while the back is regular length. the front barely reached the middle of my stomach. also, the color was not as vibrant as shown in the picture. this sweater will be going back. I bought the stained glass top/bottoms. the print is very pretty. however, the tankini top itself is not well-made. the front of it (chest area) turns out so that you can see part of the inside of the suit (which is white). it doesn\\'t lay flat around the top, and so it shows more of your chest on one side. for the price, i don\\'t think it is worth it. i don\\'t like to wear it because it makes me feel uncomfortable. Quality was not what you expect from retailer, especially for the price. top is lined but skirt is not. material is tissue paper thin and see thru. there is a point at the bottom of the sweetheart neckline that does not lay flat, it keeps popping up. however the back is very cute and for that i wanted to love it but too many negatives. was returned. Super cute and simple shirt (as other reviewer said lol). but she was right! i have another shirt from this brand and it\\'s one of my favorites. it runs true to size. it\\'s a nice casual wear with jeans kind of shirt and great for fall. it may be a little short for someone with a long torso and/or tall as i\\'m only 5\\'2 and i wouldn\\'t want it to be any shorter. So when i saw a sweater with a big llama face on the front of it, i knew it must be mine. i ordered it and eagerly awaited its arrival. while the llama print and color of the sweater are ah-mazing, the fit of the sweater leaves something to be desired. i\\'m a 36 dd and mostly a size l, so that\\'s what i ordered. it wasn\\'t snug, but it didn\\'t have the cut to pull off the oversized drapey look, so the areas where it was loose looked...strange. the sleeves were really long too, but i could have rolle I agree with everything the other reviewer stated. this top is very billowy and runs large, it would be nice if i didn\\'t have a chest! the other issue with this top is the macrame detailing is made more out of a satin like material and i wanted it to look closer to natural raw fiber. the pink is slightly more pink in person but it\\'s not that far off. had to return. Highly recommend these jeans! they are ultra-soft and fit your body like a dream. the wash is flattering on them as well. i was looking for a pair of jeans to be my go to and ultimately landed on these. they do runa little big but they do not stretch out much so i went with my usual size. I love the pattern of the red/orange dress. i bought this online for easter. i\\'m bummed. i felt frumpy. the dress fit. i\\'m 5\\'5\" athletic build and i bought the xs. it is just not flattering on my frame. i looked like i had big hips, the waist band was not creating a waist for me and i need that... i wanted to keep it but sadly i will be returning it. my husband agreed i should return it. Love this shirt it has a femine look with a casual style. Fabulous fabric, adorable details. fitting is very, very odd. it\\'s non-adjustable in any way. the fabric has no stretch at all around the middle and the underwire of the bra is very stiff which i found painful. the straps were kind of loose, but there is no way to tighten them because of the frills. when i bent over, the shorts exposed the bottom of my butt. i\\'d get a larger size, but then i can\\'t adjust the straps and they would definitely be too long and leave my breasts very exposed. overall, Fits very strange. odd cut. does not look well on. I found this dress to run large (like the other reviewers have mentioned). the quality is really nice, and the sweater fabric is a nice touch. it hit me right above the knee, and i an 5\\'5\". it is a purplish pink (as pictured). if it fits you properly, you will be pleased with the quality, color and unique style. This is a super cute peasant top. super light weight and perfect for summer, looks good with jeans or shorts, perfect for summer, spring, or fall. colors are super pretty and bright. If you like to wear lampshades this is the shirt for you. beyond unflattering. boxy and seriously looks like lace was stitched to the bottom of a lampshade This suit is well made, and is so darn cute. i usually wear a 6, but i am a size 8 in this (8 us size, although the main tag is australian size. they send out based on the us size ordered). the only issue i have is that i have a long-ish torso compared to my size, so it\\'s ever so slightly tight in the crotch, but not enough to make me send it back. i have small boobs, so the extra padding is nice. i\\'m and athletic 5\\'6\" and 130 lbs. This is a beautiful dress, but the fit was strange. i have a small waist and larger hips. i generally wear a 0-2 in a fit & flare style, but styles like this i generally wear a 2-4 for my hips. even in a 4 this was catching on my hips and looked kind of dumpy on my top half.\\n\\ni really think this dress would be great on a frame that had wider shoulders and smaller hips. it really is pretty. Really wanted to love, the top was very flattering and loved the material: very swingy and forgiving. but way to much material, i was drowning in it. sized down to x small but no go. The shirt cuts too high up and is very awkward looking on. sent it back. wouldn\\'t buy even on sale. I bought these and returned them almost immediately. the material looks nice, but itchy and heavy. the fit is too small and just uncomfortable to wear. Very cheap looking material. looks cheap to cost $158. Oh how i have searched for a mid-rise bottom that was not matronly, and finally i have found one! they cover just enough of the back without looking like my mothers bathing suit butt, and the ruched sides add just enough interest to not be boring in a solid color. and speaking of the color, the blue is beautiful. i am happy with these and hope they hold up for several years. i am 125 lbs and the small fit perfect. Thought i would love this product, but i had to return it. the fabric and design were very nice but the length was very short and the neck too tight. i ordered a xxsp which is usually the size i get. if i had known i would have ordered a regular xxs. not sure if this would have solved the problem. might be worth going to the store to try. Such a pretty fall sweater. nice fit. wore it once out shopping and it snagged :( had to return, sadly. This is a beautiful kimono but just isn\\'t made well. the one i received already had a couple small holes and a pull in the thread that was very noticeable. after reading the additional reviewer who wore it an hour and it was already pilling, it is going back for good. such a shame! Completely oversized top, size medium was swimming on me.....boxy, baggy, shapeless -- what more can i say? even in an xs this would not have fit in any way like the photo, returned. This sweater has the weirdest stitching, although the buttons on the sleeves are a nice touch and the hunter green color is to die...poor fit means poor sweater :) At last, in a world of loose, billowy silhouettes, a draped top that falls a little closer to the body! the fabric is of good weight and has the right amount of stretch.\\n\\ni also love the retro/vintage pattern of the fabric itself. the fit is feminine and comfortable.\\n\\nyou will have to wear a camisole with this top, but i do not consider that a negative. it is the way of the deep v neck. I usually love bordeaux so i was very disappointed with this shirt when it arrived. the fabric smelled plastic-y which is a first for me with retailer products. when i put the shirt on, i could see it had that sheen that comes from rayon spandex blend shirts, i hadn\\'t noticed that it had spandex in it when i ordered it. this fabric looks and feels exactly like the cheap blends sold at discount stores. i can\\'t believe retailer is selling this. I love this dress as far as the fit goes. it makes my curvy figure loook even better with how it\\'s cut. that being said the different patterns over each boob made the dress look crazy. it makes you look quite lopsided in the chest. wasn\\'t just me, but my store people also agreed. had the pattern on the chest been the same it would be great, but even though my boobs are of \"mostly\" equal size, they looked too crazy. it\\'s quite noticeable on. so sad:( There were no reviews, it\\'s an \"online exclusive\" and thought it might look good with a nice skirt at an upcoming wedding. the spandex jersey back looks like sweat shirt material. on the white version of this, it is mismatched with an oatmeal color and white that just looks awful. as a busty 36d i was stunned to find myself swimming in a medium. it does not look like the photograph and the sleeve billow out. i feel like this had to have been clipped and tucked in for this photograph. i\\'m an anth This sweater was unflattering me, very boxy and did not fall on me like the model. soft fabric and looks nice off, however this one went back. Ordered this online in the pinkish color. the material is a little thin. as a busty, curvy lady this one just didn\\'t sit right, ran a tad large, and looked boxy. if you have a thinner frame, may be a better look for you. detailing is nice. I love this dress! it is perfect for a wedding, brunch with friends, or even work. it is beautifully made and is comfortable. i have it in the yellow colorway, but i am tempted to go back and purchase it in the purple colorway as well. I had loved this on-line when i saw the pretty floral pattern. however, in person, it is such a disappointment. the quality of the fabric and the fit are just very poor. I personally love this romper. there\\'s a lot of fabric to it, so it feels lush and substantial. and the pockets! they\\'re so roomy i actually couldn\\'t find my phone for a hot second. the crotch of the legs (because, yes, this thing is actually pants) is very long and so i was very comfortable sitting.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe two things i don\\'t love about this piece include the downfall of all rompers imo: not bathroom-break friendly. you basically have to disrobe. and since the legs are so long, you end up clingi This dress is beautiful but the bottom half was too tight for my shape. I love the pattern of the red/orange dress. i bought this online for easter. i\\'m bummed. i felt frumpy. the dress fit. i\\'m 5\\'5\" athletic build and i bought the xs. it is just not flattering on my frame. i looked like i had big hips, the waist band was not creating a waist for me and i need that... i wanted to keep it but sadly i will be returning it. my husband agreed i should return it. So disappointed. i love retailer! this was a huge disappointment. i am 5\\'3\" and 120 pounds. when i put it on, all i could think was that i looked just like a clown due to the big cowl neck and how large and round the dress made me look. if i wasn\\'t so disappointed, i might have laughed. this had to have been a design mistake. i\\'ve truly never seen something so unflattering. Ok. so this coat is amazing! it\\'s high quality, soft, great pattern. the knit lining helps to make this more of a light weight coat than a sweater type coat. it\\'s been warmer this season so i\\'ve worn it as a coat and received many compliments. it might not be warm enough for january in new england but i bought a size up so i could wear it over a sweater and still use it as a coat. this was purchased on sale w 25% off sale code, so for me, that was a steal. so happy it went on sale! give it a try I wanted to love this dress - and did from the picture online. when it arrived, the black already looked faded and old. also, the embroidery looks like a grandma, but not in a cute vintage way. the fabric is stiff, which causes a boxy, unflattering look. had to return it. I was so excited to try these, it\\'s hard to find cute bermuda shorts. the legs were so wide. my husband asked if i was wearing his shorts. they don\\'t look that wide in the picture. i am 5\\'4\" and 130 lbs i bought my regular size 28 but the waist was huge i could have sized down one or two sizes. unrolled they came to my knee. I was really excited about this sweater, but the fit was terrible. the sleeves were the right size, but the body of the sweater was a tent - absolutely no shape. they must have clipped the sweater on the model. for reference, i\\'m 5\\'4 and 120 pounds and ordered a size small. I purchased this dress to wear to a beach wedding. i loved the color, the fit and the style. i even got a lot of compliments on it. the problem was that the wedding was on the beach, in florida 85 degree weather and when you are sweating the fabric changes colors and takes a really really long time to return to normal! unfortunately i had to return it. would be great to wear indoors, just watch getting water or anything else on it! Loved how this draped and im super petite 5\\'1\"(32b bust) and this was seriously one of the most ill fitting items i have every owned. i purchased the pxs and it was huge. i hope this has a better fit as the other reviewers seem to have a more positive review. i was just appalled as to how bad the measurements were off. unfortunately the straps are not adjustable so this went below my chest. too sad retailer, please get the fit right!! This is such an ethereal flowing dress.more gray than light blue as it appears in pix.love the flowy bell sleeves.its a modest length just above the knee.quality a bit lower than is the retailer norm but still good. I typically wear an xs to s in tops and purchased an xs for a less flowy fit.  this top has a luxurious feel and the green color is really beautiful (more matte than shiny).  perfect piece to wear under a jacket or blazer. Huge with bountiful amounts of extra fullness....not like represented picture. and it snags very easily. i have a 4 mo. old puppy that jumped up on me as i was trying it on and snagged it in several places. \\'i\\'m going to see about returning it with the snags. If you\\'re a little afraid to rock a jumpsuit this one\\'s for you. the palazzo leg makes it look a lot like a dress. a light shelf bra was very supportive even for my d/dd cup. it does run large. i\\'m typically a 14/16 and was easily able to fit in the 12, although the look it a bit racier on me due to cleavage. hides any tummy you might have very well due to the flowing cut. the fabric is light and comfortable. my only complaint is i wish it was a tad longer. i can not wait to rock this at a weddi This skirt is a rare find. slimming, flowing, and best of all, it finally sits on my waist and not on my hips, while hugging the hips in all the right places for the streamlined and sexy look. the fabric is substantial, yet soft, so no weird sticking out sides. the color is delicious very pale-tea-rose, better in person that the picture here, and is fresh for summer. nice length for office. easy to pair with either fitting or loose top/s and jackets. i also got a distressed denim pilcro west to Love everything about this dress except - it runs huge.  i am busty and usually wear a 12 in dresses, but the large was completely shapeless on me.  will try medium and hope it is better bc otherwise i love the dress!! Lovely dress, fits great, very flattering, flirty, loved it so much ordered another one in a different color, can\\'t wait for warm weather so i can wear these dresses Love this tank. it\\'s nice and loose and looks great with all kinds of bottoms. it\\'s very forgiving if you have a midsection. it\\'s soft, and great colors. really nice for spring casual looks. Just not as long as in the picture. it hit me at my hips not good! Material is heavier so maybe not for summer months, but fit & feel great. love that they fall beyond the knee where other leggings can fall just below the knees and be uncomfortable and restricting which makes no sense for \"active\" wear. This tee fits true to size, not oversized. the material is super soft and the colors are delicate. the armholes don\\'t show your bra which is hard to find. nothing bad to say about this top except that my size was sold out in every color but lavender (which was lovely!). Unique pattern. got lots of compliments! great fall accessory! Love this top!!\\r\\ngreat colors and fits great\\r\\nreasonably priced I\\'m so disappointed this dress didn\\'t work out! i ordered the size medium, post baby i\\'m a solid dress size 6 or 8 depending on the designer.\\r\\nthe cashier was laughing with me how ridiculously huge this garment was when i held it up. \\r\\n\\r\\nalso the length was super long, description says 35\" which would be mid thigh for me, but this thing hit me mid knee. also, like the previous review the shoulders are tented and poofy. so bizarre and the cut reminds me of a maternity dress, but the shoulders def This really is a pretty top. i do wish it was a little thicker but it\\'s not as see-through as other tees i\\'ve seen. Love this top. looks much better on than the hanger. the color and fabric are very nice. Super cute but order at least one size up I was very excited about this dress having seen someone where it on the street months ago. i got my usual size 6 and could not button it up for the life of me. i get it, i\\'m busty and sometimes button downs are a tricky. however, the arms were impossibly tight. my boyfriend starting cracking up when he saw my arms busting out of the sleeves. 1. i like a shorter jacket, but this one was poorly made and poorly fit.\\n\\n2. the sleeves were way too tight. i\\'m a size 10 or 12, and the large which would be a 14 had tight sleeves that wrinkled up my arms, and the hem of the sleeve turned inside out.\\n\\n3. i ordered both a medium (size 10) and a large (size 14) , and neither hung right. the m too tight, and the large too loose in the body and too tight in the sleeves.\\n\\n4. very polyester with lots of static.\\n\\n5. cute idea, but not very good in pe I bought this online. this looked like a sweater that was accidentally shrunk in the dryer, when i received it.\\r\\n\\r\\ni will be returning this. Great top that can be worn so many ways. i bought the top in gray because it is way more interesting in person. it has just a touch of sparkle in it and lots of texture. i have seen this top on several people and it seems to flatter lots of different body types. This skirt is a great addition to my wardrobe. the print is sophisticated and style flattering on any body. it can be dressed up or down and could be worn most of the year. maybe not on those hot summer days, but mild ones, for sure with a pop of color tank or t. I usually wear a s. the reviews were helpful. looking at the pic this shirt does look a little on the fitted side. i ordered a size m & it fits perfectly! the sleeve length is fine too! the colors are dark, not as in the photo. i do like the frayed edge look too. i have some skinnys like that. i had been looking at this shirt for months but thought it was a bit pricey. at the sale price plus the promo discount it makes it very much worth it. no regrets. hope this isn\\'t tmi.. of note: the dark bl This dress has great potential. i happen to have a longer torso so the fit was off. as a previous review stated, it\\'s short waisted and a lot a skirt which i agree, the hem is also funky. i am still deciding if i want to keep it, but if i do, i plan on altering the skirt to be narrower and hemming it a bit shorter too. for reference, i\\'m 5\\'3\" and weigh 110 and i purchased a size 0. I bought this dress because it looked sooo comfy. and it is! the fabric feels nice and it fits loose without feeling like a burlap sack. it\\'s perfect for running around town for errands. i actually didn\\'t think my boyfriend would like it because he generally likes more form-fitting pieces (yes, big surprise) but he actually commented out of the blue that it\\'s really sexy. comfy *and* sexy?! score! I though this dress would be similar to the turtleneck swing dress by maeve. it\\'s not. first of all, it runs very large. i purchased a small (i am usually a xs or small in maeve, i purchased a small in the turtleneck swing dress). the shoulders were very wide, you had to manually cross the fabric around your neck but it didn\\'t lay as flat as what i wanted around my chest, and it was quite large around my rib cage and stomach making it rather shapeless. i really wanted this dress to work (i love I do like this top. i bought the cream color and it is flattering, but it is a little shear. i need to wear a cami underneath it. it also seems to be a little on the large side. This product is the best if not the most excellent garment i have purchased in years i feel like a model even though i am full body lady what gorgeous piece of clothing This top runs large... an entire size. i am on the fence about it.. it is quite *stylish* and well made. it is fairly heavy and seems like it would be very warm. the burgundy color is nice. the issue i am having with it is the way the lower black arms are sewn in the upper arms. it just seems somewhat *odd*. overall though, it is very *forgiving*,especially with the black border around the entire bottom. it is the perfect top to showcase a great long necklace and it would be great with leggings So simple to throw on with jeans, or you could dress it up. the ruffles give it a little extra flair. nice and soft, really comfy. i haven\\'t decided which size i am going to hold onto. i ordered in a small and a medium. small fits me great, and i am usually a pretty standard medium. i think it just depends on what look you are going for.  wish they had it in a lighter color, like an ivory or pink.  i think the ruffle detail would look nice with a lighter shade. Love the bright color of this dress for spring and the loose fit and light material are very comfortable. I was drawn to this top because of the interesting and detailed straps, which are embroidered with a lovely triangle pattern. however the embroidery takes away any stretchy-ness or give in the cotton and makes the top a beautiful but ill-fitting harness for anyone with any breasts or full-figured lusciousness. the worst part is that the top hem along the top is embroidered and rigid just like the straps, so it feels like you are wearing an uncomfortable strapless top. i wanted to keep this but h I was excited to get this shirt in the mail, i liked the pattern a lot, but was so disappointed when i tried it on. i am 5\\'4\", 130 lbs. and wear a c cup so i tried ordering a small as a starting point. there was enough fabric on the sides to make another shirt! despite the excess fabric, the shirt pulled open in the chest area, making it a complete fail. i\\'m sure the model in the photo must have the shirt clipped in the back to pull in the excess fabric, especially since she\\'s small on top. ther This dress is gorgeous! i sized up from my usual 6 to an 8, cause i\\'m not much for form fitted dresses. however, it was still pretty body con for me. i passed in it for now, but in the future i might try a 10 petite?? the color is a nice brick red with a textured whitish pattern. and it is soft ... like i wanted to snuggle up on the couch in it, but i had to refrain! i\\'ve been having bad luck with zippers from retailer dresses recently, but this one was smooth sailing and pretty too! the length wa I bought this suit based on the great reviews. i was so bummed when i tried it on. the top fit so well but the bottom kept bunching up. my torso is on the longer side so maybe that\\'s why the bottoms keep coming up. every time i pulled the shorts down, the top would come down too, and vice versa. i am 5\\'5 and 120lbs and bought a 2 which is my normal size. i did like that the top had a bit of padding but that\\'s the extent of what i liked about it. i will be returning it. Can\\'t say enough about these pants.\\ni often find leggings to be to revealing when wearing them with long but not long enough top. i have a longer torso so finding tops that hit this sweet spot is an issue for me. i also don\\'t love long flowy tops with jeans all the time. the portions look all off and i look and feel heavy in my middle section.\\ncue these darlings! with out any buttons, zippers on the front your shirts will lay flat and crisp. i feel comfortable and appropriate at my causal work o I saw this in that postcard \"catalog\" and it drew my attention immediately, so when i saw it at the store, i knew i would try it on.\\r\\nthis dress is gorgeous - the lace is sturdy and won\\'t easily be caught on things, the chambray is substantial but light. it\\'s put together well and the slip covers greatly. the material isn\\'t stretchy, but it keeps it shape and i like that. i\\'m 5\\'7\" and it hit me right at the knee, so it\\'s a good length if you wanted to wear it with a cardigan to work as a spring I loved this dress and tried on the xs in the store and then ordered the petite. i thought if i ordered the petite it would not be as baggy. it is just way to boxy/baggy for someone my height and weight. however i would recommend to someone taller because the velvet is great quality and it would have been an amazing dress to have for fall and also for winter. for reference i am 5\\'0\" and weight 113 pounds. I am a size  14, and tall.  i was afraid that it would be too short.  the sales clerk grabbed a large,  and it fit! it\\'s airy and lightweight and hugs nicely around the back.  the big surprise?  pockets! love it! Adorable skirt. the eyelet part on the bottom is cut-out so see through but cute and subtle. found it fit a little snug on me- could just be my build, but i ordered it in normal size and 1 size up. the size up fit best. I love this tank, it is so comfortable but it does have its flaws. it rolls up every time i walk or do anything, it becomes very bothersome. I bought this top in my usual xs size in black and it fit just right. it\\'s very flattering and i love the strip of buttons down the back and the tucks at the shoulders. two things that i did not (could not!) notice by looking online is that this top is actually knitwear! it\\'s still very lightweight and it has a fabric strip that runs along the back strip of buttons. the second thing is that it\\'s a bit transparent. i would definitely prefer to wear a camisole underneath if i\\'m wearing this top to This simple lace top is beautiful and easy to wear, but do not wash it. the hem completely fell apart for me! Love the colors and design, however the sweather is much boxier than what the photo shows, and it is itchy. i am still deciding as it might be fine with a shirt worn underneath it. I\\'m a big retailer buyer- and usually love the dresses, especially the petite xs maxis. this was the worst retailer purchase i have ever made. \\r\\n\\r\\nit was humongous and gave me no shape. even if i purchased an xxsp it probably would be the same. i\\'m small but i mean come on- this would only fit a giantess-- which also makes no sense because it\\'s the petite size. \\r\\n\\r\\ndo not buy. i\\'m very upset i have to pay the $5.95 return fee since i ordered this. Loved the design and quality of this suit but the cups seemed huge. i weight 135lbs 5\\'6\" and wear a 34c. i bought a large in this suit because other reviews said it ran small (normally i wear a size medium) i did like how it fit everywhere expect the chest. i\\'m wondering if the medium will still be too large in the chest and hoping the rest would still fit okay. not sure i want to go through the hassle to exchange and it not fit again! it\\'s so cute otherwise and would be perfect if you have a la I loved this shirt when i got it. it fit perfectly, and was so soft. but when i washed it, following the instructions, it shrank up to well above my belly button. i\\'m talking 6 inches of shrinkage, at least. Bought these pants for a long trip through south east asia. tried them on at home and instantly fell in love with the relaxed yet styled look. will be incredibly versatile on my trip which i need as i am bringing only ~15 pounds of luggage including the bag. they seem breathable and are light weight. super flattering as they are slightly slimming and don\\'t bunch up at the waste. i got the greenish color. This looks nothing like it does on the website. it runs small and the colors are so muddy. it doesn\\'t drape nicely and i a musually an xs and this was short, stiff and plain ugly. sent it back immediately. This blouse does run large especially in the length of the sleeves (but the rest of the shirt fit well) pretty pretty blouse. hides bulges, runs a little long. super soft material. a must have for fall!!! I wanted to love this sweater but it is a return. it is a very weird fit, very thick, rug-like material and unfitted. the shoulders are bulky, the top is big and the booty is small. i am 5\\'2\", 34c and typically wear a small. the arms were very long, way too long. i will say other than that the top was true to size, may look okay on someone who had a larger chest and a smaller bum! These look much cuter in the picture than in person. i found them to be very thin and cheap looking. i am pretty sure you could find a similar pair at a budget department store. This dress is gorgeous. it looks exactly as it appears on model. the model must be wearing a petite because the regular size dress is maxi length on anyone 5\\'8. the petite is midi length and is perfect every where else. i am not petite, but this petite worked perfect on me for midi length.\\npros of dress\\nthe dress has nice light float fabric, with colorblind on bottom for a touch of modern.\\nthe dress looks very dowton abby and the vintage look is hard to find now days in dress.\\nthe dress looks fa I first saw these in store, but decided to risk waiting for them to go on sale and no regrets! they are a great high quality and the print is exactly what i hoped it to be! Be aware that this cardigan runs small- as you can see on the model, it\\'s a form-fitting style. it\\'s not the kind of cardigan you would unbutton and take on and off as a layering piece. i would wear it more like a top with a button-up front. it is nice and soft and the black and white scalloped design is attractive. i would recommend it if you are looking for a more fitted top with this design. i\\'m not wow-ed by it, but it\\'s nice in a 50\\'s kind of way. I tried this dress on in the store. it fit okay, but the orange is so bright, i couldn\\'t bring myself to buy it. This sweater runs true to size. i am 5\\'7\\' and 125 lbs and ordered the small. it has a beautiful mix of colors that reminds me of a creamsicle. it is a well made, heavy sweater that will definitely keep you warm. if you like the feel of wool, buy it. if not, pass on it. Just purchased this yesterday in the store and i can\\'t wait to wear it! it is a perfect spring/summer top when you just want to wear something pretty and comfortable! i agree that it is big but that is the style of this shirt. so if you\\'re ok with this look, you will love this shirt! i took my usual medium and the prints are adorable! a great addition to my wardrobe! I really wanted to like this top but unfortunately it was short and the sleeves were just too puffy. it did not look flattering and will be going back. I adore this sweater!  is it a bit itchy? yes.  do i care?  certainly not enough to send it back. great length, hangs nicely. unique without being gaudy. great purchase. There\\'s are just what i was looking for! these are perfect in texture and thickness...not too thick but not too thin. super soft fleece on the inside. i both both the black and green...i will most likely but the grey soon enough. This sweater has beautiful colors & cute fur collar which can removed (nice).  i bought it impulsively.  when home i tried it on with a tee as sweater is warm. i had to take it off immediately as it is scratchy & itchy.  i could not wear this without a long sleeve tee underneath, but i would be too warm.  in the store, several sweaters had thread runs in them and from the weight of the sweater.  given the itchiness and potential to run, i am returning the sweater. After reading the previous review, i was pretty confident in ordering this dress. it arrived in the mail today, and i was so disappointed. first of all, it\\'s huge. the medium was way too big on me, and i\\'m never a small at retailer! (i even considered ordering the large in this - my normal size at retailer.) second, the colors are not as vibrant as in the photo, and the fabric felt cheap. finally, it just looked like i went to hawaii and bought a drab dress there that didn\\'t fit right. This blouse is stunning on the website ;however, it is totally sheer which you cannot tell from the photo. i was very disappointed and will be returning. I was disappointed that this dress had no pockets, as every picture on this website suggests. otherwise, it is a great color and shape. still sad though... At first i was taken by the beautiful lacework and the pictures online showing what appeared to be a loose but shaped silhouette. the pictures must have been staged with pins in the back because, in person, the shirt fits like a circus tent. without exaggeration, there is a surplus of about 16 inches.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe material is still beautiful. and because of that, i haven\\'t decided whether i\\'ll return this shirt or try cutting out some excess fabric to create a cleaner, more fitted shape. Loved the colors but the fit was less to be desired. very wide under arms & too much material. looks more like a maternity dress. i ordered a small petite & would have needed the xs but now it is no longer available. oh well. returning this. This runs really big. i usually wear s or m so i got a small but i need the xs in this top and it is sold out. i don\\'t have a store close by (about an hour away) and i hate paying shipping for returns! i will either have to plan a trip to the store or try to exchange for size over the phone. i debated keeping the small but it is really too big .... i love the style though! These jeans hug in all the right places. the high waist accentuates my body and makes my legs look a mile long! the jeans will need a trip to the tailor to be hemmed, pooling even with my highest heels. This dress is so pretty and the petite fits great in the arms and the length is good- just above the knees. the material is nice- not flimsy. i\\'m just not sure if it looks right on my petite, straight frame. the front is cute but the back is pretty baggy and shapeless. i\\'ve never worn a shirt dress so i\\'m not sure if this is how it\\'s supposed to look? i tried it with a belt but it doesn\\'t seem to work with this dress as there\\'s a band of loose elastic. probably would look better on a curvier bod This is exactly the same cut as the breton peasant blouse, which i also ordered. it\\'s extremely tight thru the bust and the sleeves are very wide at the top which adds width to the look of this blouse. it added 20 pounds! the print is beautiful. the ruffles are trimmed with a golden colored thread which is a beautiful detail. i ordered size large and am well endowed. steer clear if you have a bust. This is a really lovely jacket - silky soft fabric in a pretty color and quality construction throughout. i am so sad that it runs very small - especially in the arms and across the chest. i will be returning it . This dress was absolutely beautiful in person, but it didn\\'t end up working out for me. i wear a 10, the 10 fit, but i have a 34g chest and because of that the waistline didn\\'t sit low enough - it was just below my bust instead of at my natural waist. i really wanted this to work and think it would be great for the right person. seemed tts. love the detailing! The front material is soft and cozy, but i was surprised to find that the back and the arms were a waffle knit, like long john material, very thin and tight in the arms. cannot wear a shirt underneath it, only tank top. other than that, it\\'s a great deal I bought this shirt to wear under a black skirt suit. the fabric does have some stretch to it however if you have a normal to above boob size ... beware! i have a 36d chest and the front of the shirt hit me to the point that i then looked preggers. it was one of those situations which reminded me why i do not buy empire dresses. in addition the fabric felt like something my grandmother would have used back in the 60\\'s. it was a thick polyester type material. i think this shirt would still work f I waited so long for a small petite to come back in stock and finally it did...received the dress last week and it\\'s beautiful it was a perfect fit for me not to big not too small (my size 5\\'3\"/122lb). if you\\'re petite or very thin probably size down. i gave it 4 stars because of the quality...some of the eyelets looked a little weathered. it is lined and there\\'s no see through. agree with other reviewers though - this dress is not worth $228 price tag. The back of this t-shirt looks cute but the front looks really weird. the material in the back is quite stiff but the grey material is soft, so the front gray area ends up hanging weirdly and looking uneven and messy. i appreciate asymmetrical clothing but to me it looked like a patched up rag from the front. it fits true to size. I ordered this dress in small, my usual size (for reference: 5\\'7\", 125 lb). it is too wide. it looks more fitted in the pictures and hangs loose on me. the belt does not help much; it still looks like a sack and i feel like a girl wearing her mom\\'s dress.\\r\\n\\r\\nalso, i found that the material crumples easily. I loved this dress when i saw it. however the fit was way off. i am 5\\'7\" 120 lbs and the small was way too big from the waist down. when the xs arrived i was sure it would be perfect. unfortunately the waist hit way too high, above my rib cage and the dress was too short. it was as if it was a petite size. i was very disappointed as this is such a pretty, easy dress to just throw on for school. unfortunately neither size looked right on me and i had to return both. the material is also not the s This is absolutely beautiful.  but i am only 5\\'6\"and the dress hits my thigh about the same place as it does on the model. one lean over to pick up my purse off the floor and i will flash everyone.   so i am going to wear it with dark denim leggings and tall boots.   likewise i did not detect even a speck of black. to me it is navy and purple. i was wishing it had black because those are my favorite leggings but quite honestly i think you\\'re going to have to do navy or denim. These are really nice pants - color and style are perfect but when i first put them on they seemed like they fit perfectly on me then within 30 minutes they looked 2 sizes too big - they got loose due to the material not being firm or thick enough. i would go down a size for sure. the cons aren\\'t unsolvable so try them out! I purchased this to wear on the same day. it did have a strong smell ! i tried airing but didn\\'t help much so didn\\'t wear. tags are cut so will probably give a try after washing (by hand, my fault for not checking this part). it is a bit over my price range for a casual top, so hoping i\\'ll end up loving it! This shirt is so soft and lovely, i will be wearing it a lot...after i make one little adjustment. i don\\'t mind some cleavage, but the bottom of the slit in the middle of this shirt goes all the way down to my bra and i feel like i\\'m showing a lot of side boob...inner side boob?...cleavage? i don\\'t know what the word is, but it definitely feels out of place in a professional setting. however, i\\'m going to sew a hook and eye onto the top of the slit so i can close it and it will be more like a ke It\\'s short and wide. not a good combo for anyone who isn\\'t stick thin. I love the feel and quality of this sweatshirt. however, because of the embroidery/lace detail on the shoulders, it makes it a little stiff so the shoulders look slightly boxy. I\\'m a pretty solid 10/12 in this brand. i went with the 12 since some thought the top to run small...and i agree. while i can wear it and think it will actually stretch out with wear, it\\'s tight in the shoulders and chest. for the record, those are 2 areas i never have problems with. i\\'m a 36b and it was flattening my chest. it was also quite short on me. i have a short torso and it was barely hitting below my belly button. the shirt felt more like a size 8 than 12. I knew i needed to buy this trench from the moment i saw it on my computer screen, but something prompted me to stop by my local retailer and try it on first. thank goodness for that.\\r\\n\\r\\nat first glance, i knew i wouldn\\'t be buying this. the construction leaves much to be desired. from the flimsy, single layer of unlined, unstructured fabric, to the thin strip of fabric serving as a belt, i could easily see this being sold at a cheap store for teenage girls where throwaway clothes are a dim I think these are amazing for anyone over, say, 5\\'5\". the way these hung on me (at 5\\'2\") were very unflattering in the front. they had an unfortunate masculine effect to them. that\\'s all i can say without being crass. A great skinny jean, these grey beauties are flattering and light weight. they fit true to size, but seems a bit on the long side, bunching oddly at the ankle when wearing them with booties. hopefully they hold up to some heavy wear. Loved the material and the feel. however, it does run a bit large on the shoulders so i had to return. Even on my 5\\'1\", short-waisted, 100 lb body, this was super short. it was also super boxy. not flattering at all. the blue was a good color but this is going back. A cute dress, though waist a little too high (more of an empire waist... hitting at widest part of rib cage). this looks like it should be a stretchy knit dress, but the detailing has no give whatsoever and the dress runs quite small. i usually wear a 00, but though i could get it zipped, it wasn\\'t comfortable, and if i want to keep it, i\\'ll need to size up to a 0. i\\'m 5\\'6\", 32b-24-35. Saw this on line and decided to \"splurge\" for the holidays. arrived today and is going right back. runs very small especially in the waist. trim is a cheap ribbed fabric with a zipper. fabric is not elegant looking as in the picture, appears cheap and very itchy. sooooo disappointed. I got this sweater in the neutral color, which is very versatile. it is truly, beautifully soft and the design is very pretty -- i really like the different material of the arms and v-neck. the length is good, too, if you like longer sweaters, as i do. the downside: it sheds so badly! sweater is just everywhere after putting it on. i don\\'t think i could wear it out of the house for this reason. another reviewer suggested taking a tape roller to it to make it wearable, but i think that would take Pretty disappointed in this sweater. should have sized down because it\\'s quite wide. i also didn\\'t like the stair step. the back clung to my rear. not attractive. the colors seemed to be striking online but in reality are not. returning mine. I\\'m so disappointed. the dress looked lovely in the box, but when i started to unbutton it to try it on, two buttons split in half! it\\'s going right back. Not at all tapered at waist as suggested here by photos. i have wide shoulders and am slim, and this made me look big all around. i am doubtful a smaller size would correct this- i am 5\\'10\" and ordered a medium. also, it curls under a bit at the waist. one nice thing about the cream is that it is not see through. anyway, i purchased this to go with high waisted skirts but am returning. Cute summer/vacation dress. lightweight material but not flimsy. i\\'m normally a xs/s and i ordered the s petite which was right b/c i think the xs would have been too clingy looking. the regular length would also have been too long. I bought this tank for work, but the color of the print is slightly muted compared to the photo. i usually wear a xxs or xs (i am 100 lbs, 5\\'1) and i got the xs thinking it will be loose, which i wanted. the arm holes were down to my waist, and it was also unusually wide. the quality of the fabric is nice though, not to heavy and not too thin. They ripped on the inside upper thighs of both legs less than two months after purchase. i\\'ve washed them once, and wear them a few times a week, so they\\'re certainly not worn out. i\\'ve never had a pair give out even close to this early. i loved the cut of the jeans and the softness, and they hold their shape well after multiple wearings. the color is lighter than pictured. i paid full price (the most i\\'ve ever paid for jeans) because i\\'d heard good things about jean shop quality. even at sale p Usually i really like deletta and know the sizing and shapes. this top looked pretty in the pics and i thought it would be a nice change from a tee. it was baggy, hung low and the layers just looked boxy and shapeless. If you know the meghan trainor song (and who doesn\\'t?), you\\'ll know what i mean! i could tell by the photos online that this skirt would enhance curves, and i am fine with that. however, it is very snug in the rear. i can honestly say i had made it to my 40s without ever once wondering or worrying, \"does my butt look big in this?\"--that is, until i tried on this skirt. however, i chose to keep it since we were going to hawaii soon, and i decided it would be fine as a casual skirt and cover-up. i I was extremely disappointed when this arrived. it\\'s nothing like the red color shown, rather it\\'s a very dull reddish color. as other reviews have suggested, it is very thin and runs large. i have to return. The cascadia cardigan is a flattering piece that is perfect for fall. arms are longer, which i appreciate being 5\\'8\". the backside is on the shorter side. overall really love this piece. Beautiful top, the silk was good quality, not thin. ordered a 6 because it was selling out so quickly, wished i could have ordered the 4. will definitely try if they come back in stock. This is a very stylish casual top. it fits great! i plan on wearing it with a long sleeve black tshirt underneath or black turtleneck. i absolutely love the crochet detail at the bottom! When i first saw this in the store, i loved the idea of this shirtdress with a twist. i tried it on in my usual size 4 but could not get it over my 32d bust. i wrote it off and moved on. back in the store shopping for a party dress, i saw this was now on sale. although not right for the party, i decided to try it in a bigger size. a size 6 was not available but a size 8 was. perfection! if you are willing to size up, you will be rewarded with a comfortable, versatile dress that can be super casu This is a great silhouette and the red/black plaid will be perfect for fall. it will look great with black bottoms or with jeans. the only reason i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the outer shell fabric (the plaid) is a rayon twill that is a little bit lightweight for the silhouette, so it is bagging out a little around the zipper and the pockets. i\\'m hoping the quality will hold up. i bought this same jacket in a heavier weight camoflage printed tencel this spring from the same brand, and I usually pick the large size when it comes to fitted jackets but in this case i decided to go with size medium.  i have a broad back and round shoulders and large upper arms.  when i put the size large on, the body of the jacket looked too boxy on me.  the medium is much more flattering but i cannot put a thick layer on underneath.  when the weather gets cooler, i am pairing this with my herbalist dress and my other sleeveless garments.  i am 135# 36d 38/28/35. I ordered the mustard shade in size xl. it is so well-made & comfortable. the patterned lining makes it extra cute and extra soft to wear. it\\'s washed well too. i like the shorter length. it it fun to play with proportions when using it. i ordered the navy in xl since i\\'ve gotten such great use out of the yellow one. it hasn\\'t shed/pilled either. well-made, quirky and useful for layering! I saw this dress in the catalog and had to have it. when i went to the store it was sold out so i had them order and ship it to me in two sizes - my regular and one size larger. when i got them, i tried on my regular size first and it was just perfect! beautiful pattern and material. light and airy. sexy with the low-cut \"keyhole.\" i am sooo happy with my purchase. This skirt fit, but is very body con. if you are not comfortable with such a tight fit, consider sizing up. overall, the design is beautiful and the fabric is heavy (hides bumps). i plan on ordering one size up, hoping that the waist is not too big. I read the cleaning instructions label carefully. followed them closely. and still, the dye ran and stained some of my colored clothes. pi**ed me off! just after the first wash and even before wearing them, i have streaks of uneven color on the pants. bad quality material or dye is what causes this. now i have to go and see if i can even get out my other stained clothes. thanks a lot retailer. I got this shirt in a medium, my normal retailer size and while the short fit, the front is cropped! i am a fan of the tops that are shorter in the front and longer in the back, however this was just too short in the front. my belly button was exposed, and that wasn\\'t the look displayed on the model. unfortunately this top is going back to the store. I thought this would be a cute business attire skirt. i hate to say it, but i felt like it flared out as if i were amelia bedelia or some whacky children\\'s book character and not retailer. the fabric made it look bulky. i sadly had to return it. Fun take on the white shirt- it is flattering and fun. and yes- very soft material so comfy!\\r\\nbut as others have stated, the material is very thin so your full bra outline will show- or you throw on a cami. Fits nicely, casual and lightweight for the summer and i like the look of the cross straps in the back. no complaints! I never write reviews although i do most of my shopping online but i had to write one for this tunic. i got it in the blue and sized down from a small to extra small- although i ordered both to see. the smaller size fit better around the shoulders. it is a bit retro funky and elegant at the same time. great price for such a quality piece. I\\'m 5 ft 7 125 lbs true size 4 and these pants made me look like i had boy parts. super disappointed! Love this sweater. it fits true to size. fun and different. purchased 30% off but i don\\'t think the price it terrible depending on your clothing budget. The small, zipped and laid flat, measures 16\" across at the bottom of the armholes, 11\" at the waist and 18\" from shoulder seam to bottom edge. it\\'s too small for a size 0, and not by just a little! too bad, because it really is very pretty. I saw this in store and had to try it on! it is really cute. i love the different textures and the red drawstrings. it fits well, although i am somewhat between the small and medium sizes. i went with the medium in case i want to wear a bulky sweater with it. really cute and i have never seen a coat like it! I disagree with other reviewers on this. it looks a lot better in picture on the model. i found it to run large and not fit in the most flattering way. fabric feels great. i want to love it but it is going back. I think these are a cute pant. they run large in the waist/seat area but not in the length. i\\'m 5\\'4 and this gathered at my ankle. i like them even though i have to keep hoisting them up. keep in mind the tie to tighten the waist does not stay Soft pretty socks. a little big if you have smaller feet. i\\'m a size 7.5, and they are a tad too big but still comfortable. I decided to give these trousers a try, despite my reservations about the appropriateness of the flowered embroidery on the fabric, given my age. girls and younger women can wear these types of pattern in public, but not me. for me, it seems too much like pajama wear, so wearing them as house clothing also didn\\'t appeal to me. i\\'ll be returning them.\\n\\nthe length is why i took off one star. how many petites have a 31\" inseam? i would need to have them hemmed. if you\\'re looking for loose fitting, This top is simply amazing! it\\'s a statement top everyone should own! the green is so rich and full of life! and the floral pattern is just beautiful!! i got so many compliments on it and i felt like a million bucks! confident and trendy! love love looovvveee this top! This is absolutely huge.  it felt like it was at least 2 sizes too big - the empire waist wasn\\'t even semi- fit.  36d chest and size small was like a tent.  however, the embroidery was beautiful It was very pretty,but it ran very big , sadly i had to return it. This was a disappointment because beautiful fabrics with interesting design are a rarity--and especially at this length! unfortunately, this is a mess in terms of proportions. if a size 2 can barely get it off, then there is a design flaw. sadly, the fit was so strange that it did not seem that simply sizing up would correct the flaws. Very soft, comfy, lightweight sweater. perfect for layering as the weather gets cooler. looks great with jeans or jean shorts. Absolutely love this dress. maeve dresses have always been constructed with great care and quality. i am and always have been a size med in maeve dresses. the dress is soft and flowing. the fabric is very forgiving and moves with you. i recommend trying on a dress by this maker . . . their cuts are consistent, so i feel extremely confident in buying their clothes online. this is a keeper and can be worn year round. Well fitted kinda slouchy sweater. matches photo and product description. looking forward to cooler temps! I really liked this dress. it\\'s so comfy, i could sleep in it plus it\\'s quite flattering. however, if you have a tummy, which i do, you have to really suck it in. the dress will show bulges but the layers make it a little more forgiving that the typical fitted dress. the length is great and conservative enough that i wore it to work today, though it does ride up as you walk. the blue is dark enough it could almost be worn with black shoes, almost. the top is really cut well with the perfect neck A little treat for me. i work from home and am sick of all my boring tops. this is a comfy little updo number. I tried this cute black dress on in the store and even in the xs it was a little too big. i\\'m 5\\'3\", so if they had petites available in the store maybe they would have fit better. just found too much material around the middle even though it is meant to be a loose fitting dress. the material is heavy weight, very stretchy, but not a thick fabric. could be great in the summer. I love this shirt for a throw on and go.  hangs nicely and fits great.  colors are more vibrant in person.  i love mauve, i think they do a great job with their designs! I wanted to love this top, but it unfortunately did not work for me. the material has a nice weight and feel to it, and while i love the pattern, the shape leaves something to be desired. the cap sleeves were a little tight on my arms, and the cut of the sleeves made my arms look big. the body of this shirt reminded me of a loose maternity top. for reference, i am 5\\'10\" 140 lbs and typically a size 6. i wear a small in retailer clothes, and got a small in this top. i think an xs would have been to Beautiful,well made top.it just runs small not for me I loved this dress online and was luckily able to locate it in a store about an hour away from me. i drove to the store to purchase it; however, when i tried it on, i was so disappointed! the print is adorable and it is made of great quality, but the swing style is definitely more than mini! i could have fit 3 of myself in this dress. it is definitely not as depicted in the photographs. also, the background of the dress is way more pink than appears in the photos, and the floral print isn\\'t as r Purchased this in-store today. i\\'m normally a small, but tried on x-small before trying on my regular size. the x-small fit perfectly. i\\'m 5\"5, 135 lbs, with wide hips and petite derriã¨re. the dress fit well, slightly hugging my bottom. while i don\\'t like things that draw attention to my bottom, with an outward tug or two of the stretchy material of the dress, it fit perfectly. sweater dresses tend to be bulky, so it makes sense to down size. definitely a nice addition to my closet. If you like loose flowing tops, embroidery, and fluttery sleeves, you\\'ll adore this top! i went a size down and it\\'s a perfect fit. Really wanted to love...but...the way it fit..lower part a tad too flowy...almost maternity like to hide a belly and the top area feels like my chest is being smushed! despite my bra size being a modest 36b...the look it gave was square on top almost block like with bottom that had flare...such a pretty top unfortunately the overall design just didn\\'t work me. While i love the fabric and the pattern, this skirt leaves too much to be desired. the full price is absurd considering what you get.\\r\\nthere is no mention online that there is no built in slip, and as the material is extremely thin a slip is an absolute must. (see attached photo.) even in dim lighting you can see straight through. \\r\\nalso for this price point it is strange that the skirt is \\'pull-on styling.\\' i would say that it is true to size, and i am usually a medium @ retailer, but i have a sm I just got this dress in the beige color and i absolutely love it. the fit is perfect and i feel that it is just the right length. i got a small and i am 5\\'9\\'\\'. the pockets are a great touch and really are the key for tunic style dresses for me. i love the soft material and could live in this dress. such a great staple for my closet! Absolutely beautiful top, worn once...hand washed and that\\'s all she wrote..ruined!! the black trim bled all over the top!! i tried everything you could imagine to get this back to normal! do not recommend!! :( This sweater is a lovely color and very soft. however, the sweater \\'sheds\\' terribly and the color is very large distracting from the overall appearance. it\\'s also thin and whatever shirt is worn underneath will show through. These embroidered jeans are very nice. they also exist in a lighter wash which i prefer because it shows off the embroidery better. the embroidery is dark navy which is almost not visible in these darker jeans. i guess if you like something very subtle these jeans are for you. i personally would have like a more contrasting color either white or red for the embroidery. these jeans are loose and expand with wear, it is perfectly ok to size down. I bought this dress for a holiday party, and the sequins on the dress were so much more blue that what it looks like in the photo. i still liked it, but when i went to try it on, it was just not working. i thought this was more of a loosely fitted look, but the upper bodice and waist seam are very tightly fitted. i would recommend sizing up, but be aware that the top straps (shoulder to breast) are too loose to begin with, so they may sag.\\n\\noverall, i wouldn\\'t recommend this dress for the curren This fit me perfectly. i\\'m petite and it is a little long but i like the length. it\\'s perfect! so cute This sweater was pretty short. beyond that, when i raised my arms, the thickness of the sweater caused the shoulders to rise up and stay there when i put my arms down. I wish these zipped up instead of the drawstring. they are super cute but don\\'t care for the way they sit on the hips. My new favorite sweater for layering!! perfect color, length and fit. i am 5\"4, 125 and purchased my usual small. if you\\'re on the fence about this one i say try it on it\\'s totally worth it! I saw this online and loved it. plus after reading the reviews i thought why not. but if you have a big chest beware. i am a 34ddd and a pretty solid medium. the volumous front of the vest added way to much to me and i sized down to a small. had to return. I loved the idea behind this shirt but it just hangs around the waist with tons of extra fabric. i suspect the model in the photo has the shirt pinned. totally unflattering making the chest look small and your midsection appear huge. maybe if you size down it would be better- xs was not available for me to try. also the lavender color is really washed out... I bought these pants in yellow for an event where i had to wear yellow. i was weary about the color but it is so great in person. it\\'s a very bright lemon-y yellow. they\\'re high waisted and very flattering. i\\'m 5\\'11\" and normally wear a 30 and they were a little too large but nothing a tight belt couldn\\'t fix. they also hit a little bit above the ankle which initially i was worried about with the flare but it actually was a really cool look. i received so many compliments that day and am glad to This is a very pretty dress with a unique bodice and neckline. however, it seems to run small on top. i can not zip up the top by myself (zipper is in the back) even though i usually wear a size 2 or xs in this brand (i\\'m a 32d so i\\'m narrow on top). i haven\\'t decided yet if i\\'m keeping it because despite the sizing issue, the dress is lovely! This top is another winner from left of center! i love swing tops and this is just adorable. fitted through the sleeves and top portion, it drapes nicely in a very flattering way without looking \"maternity\". i love the rayon on the upper back which adds interest and a slight contrast. i purchased it in the gold color which is beautiful and the fabric is light and very comfortable. in my opinion it runs large. i\\'m usually a sp but ordered an xsp for a more fitted look but it still looked big for This top looked super cute online but when it came it was super short and boxy. looked like a tent on me. this one went back the same day it came! I was so looking forward to an awesome maxi dress.  this was not it.  completely see through.  i guess you could wear it as a bathing suit cover up.  but be prepared to knot the length or you will trip.  its an odd design. absolutely not worth the price.  i purchased the sm/md and i could have for two of me in the dress. returned this piece without looking back They look nice on the page, but they didn\\'t work on my body. made me look big and boxy. maybe if you\\'re super-skinny, they\\'ll be fine. I splurged on this pajama set for myself and now regret it. even though the design is adorable, the fabric contains acrylic and the knitted fairisle part started pilling within the first week of wear. after a month and a couple washes, it looks horrible, and the fleece part is looking a little grungy as well. so so disappointed. the top is intentionally oversized and comes down to my crotch, i could have easily sized down. I\\'m 140 at 5\\' 8\". pear shape. the pockets really opened up when i put them on and didn\\'t lay flat. loose on leg opening - which i liked. but the pockets sticking out around the hip area made my pear shape even wider. i got a medium I thought the quality of the fabric was good and liked the idea of wearing it, either with opening in front or back. it was a little larger then i was expecting and i wish it had a closure, (hook and eye or snap) at the top. it has three places in the back to tie together and when i tied them in a bow they came loose easily. overall glad i bought it. I purchased this dress on a whim. it is easy to wear and very comfortable.  the empire waist is flattering. however, the dress runs large and the lower half is a-line. the neckline is very flattering and you feel put together when wearing this dress.\\r\\ni am happy to have it in my wardrobe. a go-to piece for years to come. The fit is not as shown on the website. will be returning. I wish this came in a petite size! i\\'m going to do my best to add some stitches in the ruching to keep the middle taught. i\\'m busty (32 ddd) and the suit had plenty of coverage and lift. i will need to make additional loops in the back latch but this piece is worth all the extra work. i was surprised this worked so well for a short curvy figure. i ordered a medium. Straight out of the mail, this cozy soft adorable charming sweater was *full* of little pills. i love the embroidery, the swingy slightly oversized fit that doesn\\'t overwhelm and the high snuggle factor. wish this came in other colors and was knitted with a less fussy yarn. This sweater is very long, could be worn as a dress at 5\\'3 ! I really wanted to love this piece but it was very large. i\\'m 5\\'2 and ordered xs/s and i have return due to size. The fabric is very nice on this wrap, but it wears like a blanket. I\\'m disappointed in these pants, which looked so beautiful online and even have pockets! in person the pattern and colors aren\\'t as nice, the fabric is too thin, and the pants look cheap. the pockets are pretty shallow. the fit isn\\'t good either. i ordered up (i\\'m between sizes) and they\\'re still not as flowy as i\\'d have liked. these are too pricy as lounge pants for me to be on the fence about them, so they\\'re going back. if you buy them knowing about the thin fabric and snug fit, they might wo I wanted to love this, was so excited when i ordered it online. the fabric (blue and white) was beautiful, but the cut was bad. it fit me like a maternity top, and made me look like i was 6 months along. i have a feeling that the models had theirs pinned back, in the back, because it does not lay flat like that in front, it has a lot of fabric with no place to go but up and out. returning. Huge! normally wear a medium and this was huge and very unflattering. I bought this jacket based on how it looked on the model, and from the reviews. i found it to be super big, and unflattering to say the least. i\\'m 5\"10, 155lbs. i sent it back. Bought two of these because i loved the way they fit off of the rack. washed them according to directions and they were ruined. the material shrank up making the shirt short and boxy and the side panels ended up being rippled. definitely going to try to return these. The overall styling was great, and the dress is super-cute, if a little thick (it\\'s made of denim, after all). i ordered a size down from my normal, and even then, i was swimming in it. the worst part, and the aspect that will make me return it, is that the arm holes hang down so low that i\\'d have to wear a tank top under the dress. i\\'m returning it, though it is really cute and i love this brand. the arm holes killed it for me. This dress looked adorable online, but unfortunately, it\\'s not flattering at all, and it\\'s completely see-through. completely. the material is so thin that i can\\'t imagine it would hold up very well over time. this one is definitely going back. I cannot say enough good things about this dress. as a petite person (5\\'0), it is so hard to find things that fit well without alterations, but this dress fit perfectly. it\\'s also so well-made: the fabric is soft, comfortable, and gorgeously detailed, and the dress is lined which makes it feel durable and gives the skirt some volume (in a good, flattering way)! i got it shortened by about 2\", but this dress fits like a dream. Runs small. i\\'m usually a size sm for retailer clothing (for reference, i\\'m 5\\'4, 129lbs, 36b). the tie around the waist of this dress is not a functional tie that you can relax a bit to give yourself more room around the waist. i could not fasten the buttons to close the dress on the size 8. the size 10 fit enough to fasten the buttons but there was a lot of extra fabric and the arm holes were very large. pretty, vibrant colors but size up and be warned of the large armholes. I wanted so badly to love this sweater. the colors in the blue motif are fabulous and the yarn is soft and warm. but it does not fit me in a flattering way. i can\\'t recommend a size, because the s and the m were exactly the same size and fit. the neck is broad and bulky and overwhelming, the sleeves have bulky cuffs that come down to my fingers, and the sweater slides across my shoulders. i\\'m 5\\'6\". it appeared overstretched, and i feared it would only stretch out more over time and not be worth Contrary to the first review, i find this top to be gorgeous. the fabric has a silkiness to it (with a slightly heavier weight). the lace thru neckline is beautifully done (the eyelets are high-quality). the fit has flow, like on the model, but still a bit of shape (not the formless fit that some blouses like this have). i love the open sleeves. i am 5\\' 8\" 120lbs 34b and am happy with the xs. Loved how this draped and im super petite 5\\'1\"(32b bust) and this was seriously one of the most ill fitting items i have every owned. i purchased the pxs and it was huge. i hope this has a better fit as the other reviewers seem to have a more positive review. i was just appalled as to how bad the measurements were off. unfortunately the straps are not adjustable so this went below my chest. too sad retailer, please get the fit right!! I was very excited when i saw this in a perk email and immediately went to order it. unfortunately, the stock image of this pullover is misleading. it\\'s boxy (image makes it seem like it\\'s form-fitting) and the weave/mesh is much thicker and open in person. as shown, you do need a cami underneath. i ordered this in a small and medium since it\\'s an online exclusive and there were no other products by on the road to see reviews of to know how their tops fit. i wanted to love this. i didn\\'t think i As stated by others, this is the type of unique retailer product that i love and that makes me return to the store again and again. i would have given it 5 stars if the sleeves were lined and the body length was longer. the sleeves are indeed long, although this adds to the coziness. but i would have loved the body a bit longer like other cardigans have been. i\\'m looking forward to wearing it as soon as we get a bit more cool here. congratulations, retailer, for a winner! I saw tons of people raving about this piece so i had to check it out for myself. i love the vibrant colors and the design and while the fabric is delicate it feels amazing and light. i sadly had to leave it as the store as i am a girl with a larger chest and big hips. i looked huge and it was not flattering to my shape. if this dress came in a maxi with a high waist like i would be all over it. it is beautiful. So, ordered online. tried this on, boyfriend asked me if i was buying maternity clothes. \\r\\nback it goes. super cute but huge. This shirt is cute. i like the pleated neck as it makes the top feminine, while still casual. it is made of very soft fabric and drapes nicely. the only issue is that the seam/pleat that runs down the middle is off center. i think the fabric was cut incorrectly so the seam twists to one side after i have it on for a few minutes and move around. i keep having to twist it straight which is very annoying. First problem-i would not have ordered this at all had the description been correct. the fabric description is cotton which the dress is most certainly not. secondly, it has a really funky, cheap, unfinished, raw-hemmed slip which is simply not fitting for the dress. the keyhole in the front is super long-again, does not seem to fit the dress. i am not happy with this piece at all but it did fit tts. length is just above knee. i am 5\\'5\" 142 lbs 34d and the six was a good fit. sending this home t Very unflattering and no shape or flair. lots of extra material but no swing or shape. do not recommend. It just didn\\'t work for me. i don\\'t know if it is my fair complexion and untanned legs, but this dress was a strike out. the orange floral design and beading is beautiful and the fitting i would say is pretty tts. for reference, i am 5\\'7\" and 145lbs with 36\" 30\" 40\" measurements and i purchased a medium. the chest and arms were not too tight like other reviews stated. the length is about the length in the picture and a lot of fabric to make it very flowy. overall, very good quality and beautiful Bought this shirt on-line. wanted to love it but just couldn\\'t. i ordered the xs and it was huge and way too unstructured for my style....just didn\\'t have enough shape. had to send it back. I got the burgundy color and i do have to say that the color looks a little better online than it does in person, but it\\'s not too much of a difference. this is a really cute thong, and if you\\'re just trying to be sexy/romantic, then i think it would be fine and there\\'s nothing at all wrong with it. however, i like to wear thongs just in general because i think they\\'re comfortable and i like not having to worry about panty lines, and this is definitely not the most comfortable. the front pattern I love the print on this. it\\'s a super cute sweater, but i didn\\'t think it worked so much for a 56 yr. old with a thickish middle. the med. was a bit snug but expect the large would\\'ve been too big (5\\'3\", 150 lbs). a great statement piece for anyone with the figure to carry it. Appears much more sleek in the photograph. in real life, this shirt looks more like a pajama top. thin, extremely casual, not worth the price i paid- even in black. will be exchanging it tomorrow. The colors and fabric on this dress are really pretty. the lace is a soft blue instead of white. i have other dresses like this from this brand and really wanted to keep it, but it runs larger than the others i have. also, it doesn\\'t have pockets. if it fits you properly, i think you will love it! Beautiful, timeless dress. runs small, straight fit. can\\'t wait to wear it to work or a function, This sweater was huge, it hung down to my calves! it also is really bulky and scratchy, it feels as if you are wearing an old wool blanket. i think it is only made for really tall and skinny people. i\\'m 5\\'2\" and weigh 120lbs. and i ordered a size s, and i was swimming in it. the fabric is very thick, i may be great if you live in alaska or the arctic. it adds about 20lbs to your body frame....... I loved the criss cross part of this tank. however, it looked so frumpy on. the cut was just odd and if you are petite it felt like a tent. i was so bummed because that criss cross was awesome but it just looked so weird on. i returned it. the material felt nice too. And not in a good way. everywhere i went, i left a little of this sweater behind. within hours of having it on, i was picking balls of fabric off the couch, bed, and the sweater itself looked like it was molting. great style, fabric and fit (although a little on the long side,) but there\\'s no way i can keep it. I wanted to love these pants, but they were larger than i expected and the fabric is very heavy. almost like a thick sweater. I ordered the orange in size xl. the fit on me matches the model other than being a little shorter in length.\\n\\nthe quality is bad. i ordered two of these sweaters and both arrived, new in the packages, with one having a small hole. the knit is so thin, as is the base material. the arms are basically see-through. it doesn\\'t offer any warmth because of the thinness. i layered a long-sleeved white tee underneath which helped. the edge of the sleeves stretched out within an hour. i also had two area I loved this top when i tried it on. i\\'m usually a small or medium and ordered the medium based on these reviews. the only problem with this for me was that you can see through it in the back. it showed every lump and bump around my bra. reluctantly, i am going to return it. if you don\\'t have any lumps and bumps i think this is a great top. i wish it had worked for me. i debated about trying it on with a camisole to see if that would help, but don\\'t really want to have to wear a camisole in the The design of this top is super cute and the material is decent. the only flaw is that despite buying the smallest size (xxsp), it\\'s still very boxy on me. i wish it was more fitted at the waist which would make it much more flattering. however, since i am actually pregnant, this actually works to my advantage, for the time being. These could barely fit over my calf and did not even broach my knee. i have big calves but i am otherwise i slim and normal sized woman. these are way too tight and narrow to enjoy or to get much use out of. Very unflattering and no shape or flair. lots of extra material but no swing or shape. do not recommend. I\\'m 5\\'4, 112 pounds. xs petite was a good fit with room for a heavier top. fabric is somewhat picky, so long sleeve is necessary. overall, coat is beautiful and worth the money. nice, unique fall piece. Just picked this up in my retailer store and i love it. i bought the orange print and the colors are vibrant and perfect for summer. i am 5\\'5\" and  140 lbs. i took a small which is my usual size at retailer. could be worn unbuttoned as a sleeveless cardi over a tank. i will wear a cami underneath as it is sheer, but that doesn\\'t bother me. another shopper was trying this on in the fitting room and it looked great on both of us. i will wear this all summer long. looks great with denim. happy find! I was really excited to receive this dress. it\\'s a fun concept and different from anything else i have. however, the dress was way too short on me. i\\'m 5 ft 6 in., and the size medium was way too short. given the thin nature of the material, i did not feel comfortable keeping the dress, even for wearing it outside the office. i will have to return this dress. This item is pretty, the print on the fabric is nice and reminiscent of embroidery, but only the top portion has a few embroidered accents. my issue with it is it\\'s very impractical. the fabric is extremely thin, and you wouldn\\'t want to wear it in any weather below 75 degrees. it\\'s ridiculous to advertise this product for a fall/winter season. the tube top underneath doesn\\'t work very hard to stay up, and isn\\'t a very practical way to hold up the jumpsuit (why wouldnt they just stitch a lining This dress truly is a work of art and i am becoming a little obsessed with byron lars\\' clothing line. this is my 3rd dress by him and i have been a size 2 in the other dresses. the 2 does fit in this dress but it is a little snug. not sure if a 4 would look as good because it is meant to be form fitting. the panels trick the eye into making you look thinner too. my dimensions 32c,26,33. it fits perfectly in the hips and waist but is tight on top. I love the fabric of this shirt -- it\\'s super soft. however the fit is off -- i\\'m normally a medium and the buttons across the chest were gaping open when buttoned (never a problem for me, i\\'m a 34b and not very busty). it is also a bit on the short side, especially when the general trend is toward longer shirts/tunics. i would recommend sizing up (in fact i\\'m going to try this in a large, fingers crossed...) I really wanted to love this, but the length of the pants was so awkward and dowdy. if they were longer or shorter, this would be a win. nice fabric, not too clingy so it is attractive on top and hips. This dress is absolutely charming. i could not find the petite size, so i went with the 0 regular. it was too, too large for me. felt more like a size 4. i am 5\\'2\" and 112 pounds, thought the 0 would fit. the fabric is soft, the style charming and it is easy to fold and take on a trip- it didn\\'t wrinkle in the package it was shipped in. I love these jeans, but they run small. i recommend ordering one size up. When i saw this blouse online i thought it looked like a great combination of casual with the elegance of an intricate print. i was so disappointed when it came. the print is not centered in the front or the back. it looks like they were trying to save on the material and just cut it out wherever with no thought to symmetry. for this price the detail of centering the design was expected, especially because this is how it appeared in the picture. loved the blouse, but i will be returning it becau After seeing the picture online, i was coveting this top for a while and then retailer days happened! i immediately ordered it, but i\\'m still not sure if i\\'m going to keep it. i ordered a 2p (0p was sold out) and i was assuming it was going to be a little big, but i like flowy. the sleeves and chest are perfect but the top is cut so generously in the back (and it\\'s a bit longer in the back as well) i feel like it looks like i\\'m wearing a wedding dress. i love it from the front. i\\'m going to try to Love the perfectly placed ruching. the red lace over black and elegant. fits like a glove. gives me great curves I am 26 weeks pregnant and bought this in an xs to wear to my shower this weekend. i am delighted with how it looks on, but it really might be too big for someone who isn\\'t pregnant. I kept the size 8 of the dress and had to return the 10 as it was too roomy at the arms and chest (which is great!!!). material is nice and not too much material, hangs nice (its a swing). another win! The design of this dress was very off for my 5\\'4\", 120 lb, 32d frame. it\\'s low-cut and tight in the bust, but then very voluminous and unstructured around the hips, making me look wide there. a belt didn\\'t help much. the fabric is nice, but the overall effect of the dress was frumpy. I was so excited to get this in the mail... and loved everything about it except for the fact that it was only as long as one inch above my navel! i don\\'t know why it looks like a normal length on the model. im returning it. I was really excited about this top since i have others from retailer that are similar in styling. unfortunately, it just didn\\'t work out. i am petite with a short torso and ordered my usual size and it was way too short in the front. the top was also boxy and didn\\'t sit right. it just wasn\\'t flattering. cute top on the hanger, but just not on me. Pretty much awesome... i tried it on in regualr size jsut to see, and i could almost get away with it... too bad i dind\\'t try it on before hte 25% of f dresses... (also, i don\\'t have an occasion to wear this).\\n\\nlength is midi, but since it is gathered, i could pull it up a little so it falls in the right spot on me.\\n\\ncolor is very nice, overall sexy dress.\\n\\nmaterial is soft and comfortable, nothing wrong except i missed out on the sale! :-) I was thrilled to find this in a store to try it on. the fabric is light weight and the cut of the sleeves make it very unique. my only gripe is the length. it hits the very top of my pants. so if you lift your arms in any way because of the cut of the sleeves - the whole shirt lifts up and shows belly. but i loved the elegance of it so much i decided that i can live with the shortness. i will just wear a tucked in cami underneath. this fit true to size. After a rough day at the office, i went into my local retailer to seek out some retail therapy. i stumbled upon this skirt and knew i had to try it on. though it\\'s more than i normally like to spend, it was well worth the price. material is lightweight and comfortable yet substantial enough for work. fit is spot on (i have wider hips and a smaller waist, which typically makes me a size 12 and that\\'s what i bought). the color is a gorgeous mustard yellow that can be paired with all sorts of colors, This is a well-made top and looks very pretty in the pictures, but in person it has a little more of a gauzy look to it. it is a great summer shirt as it is light and airy, but unfortunately it didn\\'t work for me. i wear a 34c and that often results in shirts look more like tents or maternity wear than anything else. so, perhaps this works better for the smaller chested. additionally, and this wasn\\'t so much of a con and just something to note, the fabric is pretty see-through. it works for the I\\'m not really sure what the designer was trying to accomplish with this dress. the fabrics and details are pretty but the shape is really strange. for one thing, the dress has a very straight cut so there is not a lot of room for movement and the thin belt makes the shape even worse. i felt like i was wearing a really fancy garbage bag. also, the way the bottom flares out is just strange considering the cut and length. i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it was a complete miss First of all it arrived rolled in a tight ball the size of a large starbucks coffee. i don\\'t know why they do that.... you\\'re not going to be immediately impressed by something that is packaged like it\\'s cheap! second, i\\'m usually a 0-4 in retailer and mine is no where near as loose-fitting as the photo. also, he sleeves and back are a very thin waffle knit... like a flimsy t-shirt. and see-thru. the sleeves form-fit to my arms so i couldn\\'t layer under it, but i couldn\\'t wear it alone with the fa Maeve is hands down my favorite clothing brand so i am a little biased but this is just the cutest top! i saw so many pics of this top in the gallery that i had to have it. i waited for it to go on sale and ordered it in my usual size 6 which normally is perfect in maeve tops. this is just a little snug in the shoulders but not enough to send back for an exchange. if your on the fence, go for it! This tee is cute, keep in mind the white is totally sheer. but it\\'s huge. i ordered an xxs and it\\'s very loose and drapey, which is likely the style but when did sizing get to unrealistic? also, a totally sheer, basically a sort of fancier cotton tee for $60? no way. I wanted to love this top. i wanted to love it so badly i bought it twice. the design and beading are beautiful, but the sizing is off. as another person mentioned it does run short, but that was not the issue for me. i ordered my usual size in this brand and the arm holes were too tight. because i really love it, i decided to exchange it for a larger size. i did not try it on in the store because i never wear that size, and just assumed the arm holes would be larger. sadly they were not. still Right out of the bag, this top didn\\'t really match the one pictured here (it is the right top, though). the fabric was heavy and felt \"damp\" -- the way something feels coming out of the wash. very odd.\\r\\nand the fit is nothing like what\\'s shown on the model. the \"v\" is not fitted or nicely wrapped (or even tacked in place) -- it was just two loose, droopy pieces so most of my bra was showing no matter how many times i put the pieces back where they belonged (i\\'m neither \"flat chested\" nor \"busty\" I love the color of this top but the style is not flattering. i normally wear a l or xl in retailer clothes and i ordered a l in this and it was massive! i went into the store to try on a medium and it fit much better but is still very bulky around the middle where the ruffles are and it is very wide. bummer I loved the look of this sweater, but the workmanship was surprisingly poor. there were missed stitches, and loose threads throughout, and even a tag sewn to the outside. retailer was great about the return. i really wanted to keep it and was very disappointed. Great sweater, perfect weight for the office in the summer. love the delicate knit front and triple tie in the back. it was bigger and baggies than i was expecting, but it still works. I am returning. i really liked the appearance in the photo and i love aqua, but the biggest problem for me is the shape. it\\'s pretty boxy and it\\'s hard to tell from the photo, but it has a batwing shape. i also wish the lighter portion were more ivory (less yellow in it), but that\\'s based on what looks better against my skin tone. i found it to run true to size, but i thought it was unflattering (made me look wide). My favorite colors are purple and green, so when i was in the store and saw the beautiful purple flowers on the top of this blouse and all up and down the sleeves, i was was blown away. i was disappointed by the bottom of it, just huge, flowy, green fabric with no design on it whatsoever. i went with my first impression and bought it, but now that i\\'m trying it on in the house, i\\'m still bothered by the throw-away bottom of this blouse. i\\'m thinking this is just another retailer maternity t I absolutely love this dress. the color is beautiful, the fit is flattering and it is so comfy i didn\\'t want to take it off until bedtime. it is an all around winner. if i could do one thing to make it absolutely perfect i would take and inch or two off the hem. i am think of doing that but seriously i am not sure i want to have it out in alterations when i could be wearing it, it is just too comfy and cute! I love the color block concept but this top was way too boxy. the shirt was pretty much square. and the top was super itchy, too. looks so cute online but no-go in person. This dress is beautiful just like the picture. it fits true to size and is quite comfortable considering it is on the delicate side. definitely recommend this one! The cut of this shirt is lovely and well thought out, the opening for the arm are not too big like some other shirts. i liked the material and the melon/ salmon color which i ordered was more vibrant in person. this does run large so i wished i had ordered one size down. I usually buy a pair of these kind of pants every year from this brand. they are lightweight, sturdy and very flattering to my curvier body. this brand can run big, so i usually buy a size 2 rather than my normal size 4. i was going to wait it out and let someone else try them first, but then i caved and ordered them in two sizes: 26 and 27 because they didn\\'t label them 2, 4, 6 etc. anymore. these pants still look well made and have cute little details, but they are bigger than ever!! the 27\\'s I saw this in my local retailer styled with a tank top underneath and i fell in love and bought the combo right away. it is a vest, so it\\'s not meant to be fitted, so i think sizing down is fine. i\\'m usually an xs/s in tops, i went with the xs in this, and j still get that relaxed look which is nice. this vest is great, very versatile, simple yet adds great style. it was a bit of a splurge for me but i\\'m happy i added it to my closet! This top did nothing for me. it billowed in the front and was not flattering. for reference, i am 5\"4, 115 pounds, and small chested. i ordered the smallest size the top came in (cannot recall if it was an xs or 0). i promptly returned it. Great material, and i like the idea of a scoop / v neck combination. but the hem rolls up, making it impossible to wear not tucked in to pants or a skirt (and even there it\\'s a little bulky). it\\'s possible that ordering a size up would fix the problem. I ordered the coral/peach version in size 16. it ran small, especially compared to other size 14 or 16 maeve blouses i\\'ve purchased. very tight throughout the blouse. the product photos looked so nice compared to what arrived. the material was extremely cheap in quality. it wrinkled terribly. the bow pulled the material down which obscured the look of the eyelet. the idea of this was perfect for my style. unfortunately, the poor choice in material & poor fit made this a return for me. These run small. i normally wear 28 on ag stevie\\'s and paige jeans so i ordered these in 28 and they were very tight. otherwise very well made and super cute but i had to return them. I was thrilled to find this in a store to try it on. the fabric is light weight and the cut of the sleeves make it very unique. my only gripe is the length. it hits the very top of my pants. so if you lift your arms in any way because of the cut of the sleeves - the whole shirt lifts up and shows belly. but i loved the elegance of it so much i decided that i can live with the shortness. i will just wear a tucked in cami underneath. this fit true to size. I\\'m 5\\'6\", 125 lbs, wear size 2 or 4 normally, and small or extra small. 34b bra. i tried on size 2 and it fit great. this dress rocks! i live the soft material and side pockets. not a lover of a line skirts, but this one is subtle. i do need a strapless bra, but if you are more endowed than me, you won\\'t need it. the hem is unseamed, leaving it a bit edgy. since the denium is light i can wear ghis dress now and into summer. i live in texas so probabley won\\'t be wearing it after june. covering my I purchased this for a recent trip with my friends and thought it was worth the price. the swimsuit is comfortable, yet flattering and all the patterns are really unique. i received a lot of compliments about the swimsuit! the one downside was that the fabric hook for one of the straps broke so i had to sew it back on. other than that, this was a great purchase! i recommend this to anyone who wants a very whimsical, but comfy swimsuit! And this one proved to be no different. the short end of it; this dress is pretty much super thick, heavy linen with a rope like collar (the supposed embroidery you see), and there is no lining, but completely unnecessary pockets. i\\'m typically a 2 or 4 depending on the designer (5\\'7 & a super fit 135 lbs) and knew enough to order an xs in this, however it still fit like a potato sack. even upon taking it out of the plastic bag, i knew it was going back. between the unrealistic pictures and lack I wanted to love these jeans, but as a woman who is almost 45 there was way too much stretch in them. i am always a size 26 and i couldn\\'t wear these, they were way too tight! they went back the next day. i will say, it could be my body type, i\"m a runner so my legs are muscular. if you have very thin legs, these could be great and work for you. i loved the color, dark blue. I do not even know where to begin with this product. i ordered a small (i go between small and medium) and felt that would be a good fit. after trying on the shirt, i would have opted for the xxxxxxxxs or whatever the smallest size is. this shirt is very boxy. i know its supposed to have a \\'flow\\' to it, but this shirt is too much. it needs to be taken in. or have a belt wrapped around it. i tried the belt look but it did not look flattering. i found this color to be very blah. overall, i am slig Purchased to speak at an event. not only is it very eye catching and i garnered many compliments it fit like it was made for me and was comfortable to wear. i questioned ordering a 4 and possibly could have worn a 6 but with the elasticity to the material there was no problem with movement or sitting and i felt hugged in in all the right places! Just not as long as in the picture. it hit me at my hips not good! The sweater and skirt are so pretty! they\\'re really soft and have such an easy, comfortable look together. really love this gorgeous outfit.\\n\\ni am borderline small/medium and kept the size small after trying both on. This suit did nothing for me. the top has zero support. this would work for a younger woman who does not require any support and is smaller chested. also, the top gapped in the center. it just did not fit right. the top is very thin showing everything. a light padding would make a big difference in this suit. also i could not get a good fit. as i tightened the top, the back would ride up. the bottoms are ok. not renatkable I am not sure who would look good in this dress. it is extremely oversized with tons of fabric that will not flatter anyone! This top light and airy, which is perfect for spring. i\\'m usually into these types of blouses; however, this didn\\'t quite fit right on me. it\\'s a little too boxy and too low cut in the front for some reason. i loved the design and really wanted to like it... i just didn\\'t love it enough to purchase it. I loved the cut of these pants and the button accent on the pockets. however, the material was quite thin and the quality was not great- there were multiple snags along the seams. additionally, at 5\\'8, 130lbs i was swimming in the size 4. i would have tried sizing down if the quality was better. Loved the look of this sweater online. was disappointed when i took it out of the package i was surprised at how stiff and itchy it was. i ordered my usual medium and though at first they shipped the wrong size it was small all over.  it felt cheep definelty not worth the high price. knew it was definitely going back I was not a fan of these leggings. these were very unflattering. i could see that after wearing these all day they could start stretch out. i just didn\\'t feel like they would hold up for even one season. An easy top that adds instant glamour. the burnout velvet is super fun for the holidays and yet the design is comfortable and easy. i have found this top can work day and night with the right accessories. I bought this shirt in a l, since i didn\\'t want it to be too fitted and was concerned a m would be. it is so boxy! it\\'s like a completely different shirt. i have no idea how it looks good on anyone, unless it is simply widened the larger the size. maybe a m wouldn\\'t be as wide and therefore as boxy, but this shirt is just a bad mess. returning. This is a unique blouse and well worth a try. it is pure wool, so dry clean only. though it is wool, it is actually very thin and lightweight. i didn\\'t find it to be scratchy.\\r\\n.\\r\\ni am a size xl, but in this blouse the large fit fine. the narrowest part of this blouse is the width of the shoulders, everything else is very voluminous. for this reason, it doesn\\'t flatter my full figure; it makes me look much heavier than i am. my only options are to return it, or bring it to a local seamstress who I ordered this skirt because the 4 i tried on in store was huge and the 2 was way too small. the sizing was an issue so i thought i would try another 4. the skirt that arrived by mail was so wrinkled it was obvious that a day of wear would turn it into a nightmare of unflattering creases and stretched out areas. i like the concept of the design with the button front and a-line \"princess\" seams in the front and back, but i just feel the fabric in this skirt has too much stretch. i returned it. I was disappointed in this shirt. the color was not the pretty blue pictured, but rather a grayish blue which may look good on a brunette, but not on a blonde. the fabric felt like linen and wrinkled easily. normally, the quality of the fabric is one of my main reasons to buy holding horses, but this one felt cheap. the detail and craftsmanship was beautiful, and i wish this shirt would have worked for me. i waited for it to go on sale and was very excited to receive it. holding horses is one of This jumpsuit is fabulous in person! it is elegant and easy and very figure flattering. i have a very curvy shape but a 34 ddd bust so i would say i am a top heavy hourglass. this jumpsuit does me right. the only thing i would say is i don\\'t think it would be very comfortable on a person with a long torso. i am 5\\'3\" and bought this in 6 regular and the length is perfect with heels. but the whole top half fits me perfectly but shows alot of boob if i\\'m not careful. but i don\\'t think it would be s Versatile and comfy. can be worn with shirts underneath for multi-seasonal wear. I purchased this top at my local store this past weekend, and i have to say i already know it will become an easy, go-to top. it does run large, so consider that when choosing what size to order. i generally wear a medium, but purchased a small in this top. I was so excited to receive this dress only to come find out that it was not tweed, not the same colors as the picture, spandex material, the fit runs smaller than most of their dresses and the sleeves are capped. i love retailer and prefer their clothes above all other brands but i was extremely disappointed in this dress. This one arrived at my store and was sold out in two days! everyone loves it. the fabric is a woven material. very light, a little sheer but comfortable and really airy! it has a bit of weight to it, so it doesn\\'t stick at all which is a win for me. the colors are perfectly neutral. this is as long as it looks in the photos. tunic length and i love it! i am 5\\'8 and it hits below my toosh. loved wearing this with leggings and jacket, or pairing it with denim. i adore it and i\\'m so glad i grabbed Beautiful fabric with soft drape. unfortunately the \"captain kangaroo\" pockets are awful. unless you have a straight up and down shape with no hips this is very unflattering. the pockets look like saddle bags and add a huge amount of fabric where most people don\\'t want added bulk. very disappointing. returned. I was very excited to find a fun and lightweight white dress for spring/summer. for the past two years i have found two of my favorite white dresses. the material that this dress is made out of did not look high quality at all. the fit looked more like that of an old nightgown. this dress has no shape to it, although probably comfortable, not flattering. i had high hopes for this dress and wish that it looked like it does in the picture, in person. This definitely works for you - think fabric, great quality, and i\\'m 25 weeks and i think i\\'ll be able to use this to the end. got my normal-ish size. would never have kept this if i wasn\\'t pregnant, cause you can definitely accommodate a pregnancy (or maybe go down two sizes if not). this is not my first baby either! love for my pregnancy. Very pretty dress but the fit is not great. i have to get help to take it off because it\\'s tight in the shoulders. Cute top, not great on me. beautiful, bright color. This sweater is very pretty, i love the knit and the cream color. for some reason it just didn\\'t flow the way i wanted it to, and i didn\\'t love the v neck. just didn\\'t pull me in completely! Love everything about this dress! it\\'s true to size , flows nicely, great quality. it\\'s just amazing. Ordered the pink in a small, but it ran big...the xs was perfect for my 5\\'6\\' medium frame. it is comfortable and the fabric has an interesting texture. looks great with chinos or jeans. might need to get the other color. The lace on this looks like it would be stiff, but it isn\\'t. it\\'s soft and drapes nicely. i normally buy an xl (if it\\'s not a knit) and so i did. the top will fit up to a size 18 in the xl because it is boxy and generous. it fit me perfectly and just tapered my body. it looks looser in the photo.\\r\\n\\r\\nit\\'s as see through as the photo. and, i wouldn\\'t wear a cami under it. that defeats the purpose for hot weather imho. i think a nude bra works just fine. you can see the model is wearing a white bra I bought both colors based on the reviews and really like the prints. however, they are too sheer. i don\\'t want to wear a tank top, but you have to with these tops since they are so sheer. i can also see the fabric tearing easily, it is too delicate. i sent both colors back. what a waste because the prints and colors are good. these tops are also not for busty ladies. i have a big bust, and the top part didn\\'t cover my entire bust and was awkward because the division between the fabrics would st Great material. a bit loose in the middle / lower half. doesn\\'t belt well. it could be 3\" shorter, considering alterations. i\\'m 5\\'7\" the model is 5\\'10\", so yeah 3\" shorter would be cute! I was somewhat hesitant to purchase this dress, based on the previous reviews. for me, it fit perfect. the blouse was fine, not too much fabric. the skirt is soft and stretchy. the fit was tts. for reference, i am 120lbs, 34c and i purchased the 4p. it fits great! These are called jeans but they aren\\'t exactly jean material. they are black with a nice stretch to the fabric. a bit tighter on the thighs than the flare jeans but the stretch to the fabric makes it work. i like these very much, a very slimming effect. mid rise- which looks very chic.highly recommend! I loved this top, however had to return as it does run small. by the time it arrived they were sold out in the larger size. like the quality of cloth and stone, however their products do run a size small. Maeve is one of my favorite retailer designers. usually fall in love with a blouse, only to look at the tag and discover it\\'s by maeve (go figure).\\r\\nthis top is just atrocious though. does nothing for girls with a larger chest. very boxy and unflattering. gorgeous colors though, and the sleeve concept is cute. however, where the sleeve meets the shirt looks cheap and thrown on. not impressed. From quality, to design, and overall comfort...these leggings have it all. they are so so soft and feel and look amazing on. i bought the black and i love the ribbed detailing. it\\'s just enough to add a little something. i ended up buying the other two colors and another pair of black! for the price it\\'s more than worth it. This is one of my absolute favorites! the design is perfect, and the fabric is so beautiful. i don\\'t love the coral color, but the mixed pattern is amazing. it runs a little large. i sized down one size and it fit perfectly. it\\'s very flowy and comfortable. it\\'s these unique, special designs that end of being my favorite retailer purchases. i\\'ve gotten so many compliments. very highly recommend! I really wanted to like this dress. the color is perfect, the design and cut are cut (not always the case at retailer). however, the fabric quality was terrible - a shiny acrylic with cheap nylon lace. it looked like something from a discount store and had to go back. This dress is beautiful. the neckline is not too low and the straps are wide enough so you can wear a normal bra! the waist is very flattering and the ruffle at the bottom is not too much. i am short so i ordered the petite and it is a perfect fit. now i just need some warmer weather!! Love retailer\\'s kimonos and when i saw this pattern i had to have it! unfortunately, when i bought it the tag was already showing holes so they gave me 15% off... went to wear it for the first time, there was already a huge snag in it! i love retailer but for 98$ this is not worth your money. Nice shirt seems well made. good just not a great fit for me. I really loved this dress. it ran small but it was also shorter than i imagined which was only worsened because i\\'m curvier on top. would be great for slender figures. Disappointed :-(\\nthis top has a boxy shape and looked like a mini moo moo on me. i have a similar shape as the model and it looked nothing like that on me. bummer! i liked the quality and weight (not too heavy nor too light) but shape is unflattering. it\\'s going back. Ag jeans have been a main stay for me. they are the most comfortable and best looking jeans on my body. however this pair was too tight and shorter then i liked. the fabric and color is beautiful. i wear the same size for ag no matter the design. but this one ran too small. i have to return it. i will try the next size up if they still have them. Purchased the gray patterned top. seemed to fit tts, but it didn\\'t fit me. i\\'m an athletic build with a 34d bust and it just wouldn\\'t fit right around the shoulder/neck area. i\\'m pretty confident it would fit someone who is less busty than i. the double-sided fabric was soft and felt like it would wash/wear very well. nice length all around...top and sleeves. I tried this on in my usual size and it was tight through the chest because of the lining. i would have preferred to wear a cami beneath and then it may have worked. the color and pattern are gorgeous, the fabric feels a bit weird, kind of dry and rough? would have liked to see this in a longer length, and more tapered. it is an absolute pregnant top. so sad its so pretty! After reading the reviews, i ordered an xs and a s in this, though i usually wear an xs in bordeaux. i kept the xs. to me, the sleeves and shoulders run small, while the rest of the shirt is flowy through the torso. i prefer more fitted shirts, but decided this one looked ok. at 5\\'6\", the hem hit at my hip. i did not find it scratchy at all. in the pink, with a nude bra, it is not terribly see-through, but with a black bra, it is. i washed it in a lingerie bag and laid it flat to dry. maybe it s I bought the top that goes with the pants & live that it\\'s comfortable to wear at home yet looks good enough to to go anywhere. easy to care for. very happy with this!! Love love love this dress.  fits like a glove. beautiful details. amazing quality. i\\'m so happy with this dress and know i\\'ll have it for years. :) This sweater looks great in the picture but when it came in the mail turned out to be enormous. i tried it with a belt on like in the picture but that just made the whole sweater bunch up everywhere. the quality is nice. maybe sizing down would help. but the medium/large is going back. i am normally a medium. I generally don\\'t write bad reviews, but there is a real discrepancy between the quality of this kimono and the cost. the design and colors are great, but the fabric is ripping on all the kimonos on the rack in my store where the manufacturer\\'s tag is at the back of the neck. the material is very thin, so there are other small holes beginning throughout the garment. i shop at retailer all the time, and this is not a $98 item of clothing. Such quality went in to this dress - it is beautiful. the torso is lined and the tulle is not super poofy at the waist. it is, however, not made for the busty gal. i am a 32 dd, the fabric comes in at the arm pits making for narrow coverage around the chest. also this dress is short waisted, it is almost an empire on me. i wish it worked, as it is lovely. perhaps it will work on the someone super thin? so sad about it! It really is such a cute romper. took it on s trip to italy and it was airy and comfortable. that is in till i washed it. i\\'m in europe so there aren\\'t dryers... washed it in cold water, line-dried it and it shrunk. significantly. it still fits but the top doesn\\'t blouse over like it previously did. and the shorts feel really short. so disappointed. my advice would be to hand wash it in very cold water This dress is just too baggy overall. i am 5\\'6\" 140 lbs and a size small was so unflattering. i can\\'t go down in size because the waist detail will get too high on me. it was already a little high on the small. These ultra-slimming jeans are so comfy. the rise is a little higher than i am used to but it covers those little muffin tops perfectly. the color is very dark - almost black which adds to the slimming effect. i have really long legs and these have a little extra at the bottom, which is great. you could wear with flats, booties, boots - just about any type of shoes. these are my new favorite jeans. Love the wine colored cords-- but i tried them and i was disappointed because my normal size was too small. i usually have to size down in pilcro pants but not these. (i\\'m an 8, and the 30 wasn\\'t going to button!) i love the slight cropped flare! and the color! did i mention the color? but vanity wouldn\\'t allow me to buy them. hopefully i just got a mislabeled pair! But if that works for you it is a cute pattern. this is a lighter weight sweater but good for fall. This is such a great top! it runs huge though. i normally wear a small but bought the xs. it fits ok. i would prefer the xxs, but i bought it on sale and retailer is sold out. for reference, i am 5`6 and about 138 lbs. very flowy soft fabric, great purchase. This sweater looks soft and flowy on the model, but in the store it is rather stiff lace in the back and very plain in the front. i did not like the ribbing on the front bottom of the sweater because it pulled in places and didn\\'t lie flat. way too expensive for what you are getting. This is more of an undershirt than a shirt. the material is very very thin and it shows everything. it was beyond unflattering on me. don\\'t buy this unless you have a knockout thin body. The pattern and colors are very pretty, and the material is soft and silky. i returned it, though, because it is very low-cut in the front. it comes down to between my breasts, which is not going to work for me. I bought this top in black n moss. they are of a great quality n love that u don\\'t need a cami under. i do like them very much except that they\\'re a lil too billowy in front for me. when i gathered excess material on the sides it looked much better. the black didn\\'t look as large...black is slimming. i love the neck and the material. haven\\'t decided yet if i\\'m keeping or returning. Thought this looked so cute, especially for averting frame. it arrived and was too large, the fabric felt super cheap, and the lace detail on the shoulders was very prominent.... and not in a good way. returned. This cardigan looked great on line but it is one of the worst things i ever ordered at retailer. the quality is awful and the material feels flimsy and cheap. The saundra tank is a very pretty and feminine knitted top. it is soft and comes in a very delicate pink color.\\r\\ni took this on a recent trip and it paired well with capri tights and wedges. it was very comfortable to wear having a medium weight to it. the only issue that i had was that the cut below your arms is very deep and made it difficult to hide the side of your bra. it is a rather loose fit, so if you prefer something more form fitting, you might opt for a smaller size. I saw this online and went to the store to try it on. so glad i did! it did not work on me at all! it is so wide - just did not look right. it was also not flattering at the neckline either. i thought it was beautiful until i had it on! too bad - wanted to love it! I love almost all tops from retailer, however this one was just enormous. it is beautifully designed, but it was so huge when i tried it on that i couldn\\'t believe it was sized 0. i even checked the tag to see if maybe they placed a size 0 tag on an xl shirt. for reference, i am 5\\'2\" and 110lbs. i would have loved this shirt if it hadn\\'t been so big. Great sweater coat! i bought the camel color and it looks so good over all black. it runs large. i usually buy a medium in sweaters but his one i bought the small. it is very unique and a cool take on a peacoat. These looked really interesting online and with the multicolor stripes i thought it would pair nicely with many tops. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe fabric is nice and sturdy. the colors are more vibrant than online. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe design however is terrible. when i put them on i double checked to make sure they weren\\'t on backwards- the back is flat as a board but the front has these poofy pockets. the poor fit with the bright stripes gives a \"1920s circus diaper\" look which is not good. \\r\\n\\r\\nthey\\'re also really tight compar I wanted to love this dress. sadly, the styling was wrong. the stripes on the bottom half did not line up with the top and the pleats didn\\'t help. it just threw everything off and made me look distorted. I\\'m baffled why none of the other reviewers have mentioned how large these pants are. i ordered the petite small, and i\\'m always a small. these are huge. i felt like i had on a large. i like the thin material and color, and i\\'m sad that they are so large. Very cute dress but the skirt flares out more than it looks in the picture. this made my midsection look unflattering from the side. also, for some who is on the flat chested side, you need a good bra or alteration (at least for me). despite what i listed above, i kept the dress since it\\'s a versatile dress for many occasions. I bought this shirt to wear under a black skirt suit. the fabric does have some stretch to it however if you have a normal to above boob size ... beware! i have a 36d chest and the front of the shirt hit me to the point that i then looked preggers. it was one of those situations which reminded me why i do not buy empire dresses. in addition the fabric felt like something my grandmother would have used back in the 60\\'s. it was a thick polyester type material. i think this shirt would still work f I wasn\\'t able to purchase this item because i just couldn\\'t get the size right in the bust. the small puckered at the bust and i swam in the medium. bummed because the colors are so vibrant and pretty and the length and flow were great! I bought this top in lilac size s since other reviewers said it has a lot of fabric. the color and the quality were great -- loved that it had the lining underneath. if your bust is bigger than an a cup, beware. the top basically flared out from the farthest point on my bust and the fabric below just hung there. it was a pregnancy look. perhaps that\\'s why the model has her arms crossed in front -- to give the illusion that it tapers in below the ribs, but it does not. unfortunately, this one is I am a huge fan of pilcro pants, and was so excited to see them make a pair of vegan leather pants. the idea is great - leather in the front, fully stretchy fabric in the back to give a fitted but comfortable look. however, i couldn\\'t get past the way the seams and leather felt on my knees - really stiff and uncomfortable when you start walking around (can\\'t bend the leg all the way; weird creasing and bunching behind the knee). the fit was perfect everywhere else. sadly, these had to go back :( I sized down to an xs from my usual size small, and it fits perfectly. it is cropped but i like the swingy shape that will work well with high-waisted bottoms. i did have to get a replacement because my first top had some beading coming off when i received it in the mail, but this new one seems much more sturdy. Bought the green/blue - colors are bright, fabric is so soft. the neckline is just right for a small chest. the top is structured nicely, giving you a figure flattering fit. I tried this blouse on in the store. i\\'m generally an 8 or 10 in this brand. i got down to a size 4 and gave up. this blouse is huge all the way around. the detail on the blouse is pretty, but the tent like cut made it impossible for me to buy it. i know retailers blouses can be swingy and flows but this went way beyond. perhaps on a tall person the swing would work but on a short person like myself...i looked ridiculous. I bought this dress to attend a couple of summer weddings. it seemed like it would be a nice, light summer dress that i could wear all day. i do think it fits that qualification, however, it wasn\\'t as flattering as i hoped. i\\'m generally pear shaped - small waist, larger hips. this dress does fit well over my hips, but does very little to show off my waist. overall, it is just ok. I received this top in white, last fri., and have already worn it twice. it is the perfect top for hot weather because it doesn\\'t cling to the body. the top layer is flowy and breathable. i plan on buying the blue one next to get me through the warm weather months. This could seriously fit a large and it\\'s an xs. so frustrating!! this is the fourth retailer dress that is ordered that is just enormous. i get the whole \"loose fit\" style, but seriously??? you\\'ve taken it to a whole new level, retailer!!! another trip to the store to return another item. a complete waste of my time. ugh. Love tiny. i am 5\\'7\", 125-128 lbs depending on the day, and a 34a. i also have a very long torso, and tiny shirts are one of the few brands that are usually long enough for me. this one, however, was a huge miss. i ordered online in my usual tiny xs. it was much too big around and felt shorter in the front than stated, so it looked boxy on me. however, the worst part was the placket. the description doesn\\'t note that it\\'s held together with a tiny snap. that snap takes nothing to undo, and then I have the t shirt from last year and i love it so could not wait to try the dress. why didn\\'t you make it in petite? it can work with some tailoring but petite sizing esp since this runs on the big side, would have been ideal. love the navy, will try the white. how about some more colors and petite?? please??? more t shirt dresses in general too please!! I love this shirt, love love love it. i am a curvy girl and it accents all the right features and hides the ones that need to be hidden.\\nbut i\\'ve owned it for 6 months and there are already 4 holes in the shirt. and not holes in the fabric but holes on the seam lines. the stitching is not sturdy enough for the shirt to not fall apart. the whole point is to be able to wear it. but now i have to bust out my sewing machine to reinforce the seams that split so that i can wear it again. :( I loved this dress immediately. it is soft to the touch and super comfortable. i will be wearing this so much this summer! the arms are true to size and the body is flowy and roomy, but it is still flattering! highly recommend! This dress has so much potential but doesn\\'t make it.\\r\\ni read all the reviews and very few were favorable and still took my chances. fabric color and textures is great but the design is really off.\\r\\nwith the little folds on the shoulder and since the fabric is more on the thick side, all this make it to accumulate the \"extra\" weight on the front of the body and as result \"not flattering\" for the majority of ladies including me\\r\\nit is a shame since it has may great features, the style: flowy, low I have a booty, and these pants love it. they fit my curves (size 10 with flat abs, but as i said a booty) all while looking professional. at m y husband\\'s insistence i\\'m buying they grey too. Was excited to wear the dress for the first time. but while standing in front of the mirror putting makeup on, the seam between the body and sleeve just started to unravel. strangest thing - just a random hole appeared :(. I am very happy with my purchase. it is a great sweater! very easy to wear and cute! i am very sensitive to scratchy wool products and this one is very soft. i highly recommend it. I love swing dresses and normally order l , but this one turned out to be way too large. and as other customers said the sleeves are short , so the whole look is out of proportion. the colors are much brighter than they appear in the photo. the dark patches are a bright peacock color and the hot pink is just too much for my taste.the material design is not as classy looking as it comes across on line.so sad because i love this dress pictured on line and this is not it. \\r\\nthe quality of the slip I loved this shirt when it first arrived and i couldn\\'t wait to wear it. after one day of wear, i went to hang the shirt back up and it was ripping on both sides of the middle back seem. this shirt was not tight on me at all. very disappointed. Love this top! such a pretty color and so comfy. sleeves are a bit long, but fits pretty true, like most left of center. washes and dries in the dryer very nicely. This is a really cute shirt for spring. i love the colored striping and you can dress it up or down. have not worn it yet -- waiting for it to get a little warmer. I rarely write reviews, but this one deserves one. this top is completely, utterly, adorable! it flows so beautifully, which makes it perfect to wear with leggings/skinny jeans. i wore mine with a blazer for a work holiday party, and i received so many compliments. this top makes you feel so feminine and pretty. i love the maeve brand, and this is certainly no exception! i\\'d love to get it in multiple colors! I bought the black and gray fleece lined leggings. i thought the price was great. too good to be true. you get what you pay for. once i opened the box they smelled awful. it was a chemical smell. i washed the black pair twice and it was a little better. i have washed the gray 5 times and it still smells. I really wanted to love this dress! the quality is great, and the overall look is so lovely. however, i tried two different sizes (petite s and petite xs) and it still looked too baggy/big. the upper part is wider than it appears. also, the photos shows the bottom two buttons buttoned up. however, the dress doesn\\'t actually have any loop holes or button holes, so it just hangs open. very sad to have to return both dresses. Colors and patterns of this dress are beautiful and that\\'s where it ends. cheap flimsy polyester and no lining. far too expensive for what it is. on me it bulked out in my chest area and did not look so great. i would say it runs a tad big but in my case ( i have wide shoulders) not big enough to downsize. too bad because i really love the colors and idea of this dress. I really liked this dress when i tried the navy on in the store. i am 5\\'4\", 140 lb. and the medium fit me really well. unfortunately, i am not comfortable showing a lot of leg so the dress was just too short for me. if it had come to the tops of my knees i would have gone for it but it was well above my knees. the fit and color were great though, i loved the neckline and the material was very soft and comfortable. i tried the large but, while it was a little longer, the larger size made it lose I ordered a size xl. it\\'s flowy so it could be running larger but since the fit in the shoulders/neck/sleeves matches the model, i think it\\'s true-to-size for the design. it is so comfortable. i love the softness of the material. the problem for me is the color. on my monitor, it looks like a light ivory or white. but, the embroidered lace bib portion is a darker ivory shade that doesn\\'t work for my complexion so i\\'ll be returning mine. everything is well-made though, especially the vintage-styl Not as cute as photos, and too small in chest. i am 5\\'5\\'\\', 125 lbs, and the small was too tight in the chest, and i am not large here at all. shoulders and sleeve length fit well. will return. not comfortable, and will need to be able to button it on rainy days. I couldn\\'t wait to get this top in the mail since they didn\\'t have it at my local retailer, but i was so disappointed in both the quality and fit. the white is completely see-thru, i can\\'t believe how sheer the material is - especially for the price. even as the shirt is lying down, i can see through both layers of it... the fit runs small, and short. Was very disappointed with this dress. it\\'s very baggy, no shape. felt like an oversized sack. purchased in med. bust area was only semi good fit all else flopped :( I received this top in the mail today not what i expected at all! it is a great fabric just way too much of it. it is proportionally incorrect width wise. unfortunately this one will be going back. The design looked super cute online, but in person, the material seemed cheap. actually, at least in the green one, the material is different in the striped and solid sections; if it had all been the striped material, it would have been much nicer. When i tried this top on, i started laughing. the two rows of ruffles are made of a starchy thick cotton, which, instead of falling by the hips, juts out like wings. it\\'s also huge. cute idea, wrong material and placement. This top is comfortable and vas easily be dressed up or down! love it I have a 36c bust. i bought this blouse in a 10, even though i wear an 8 or 10. i sized up based on previous reviews. this top was super tight in the bust (it literally flattened my breasts) and very loose on the bottom. it was not flattering at all. the material is gorgeous. it is thick. it is lined. it is darted at the bust and it flares out in a peplum fashion where the light fabric up top meets the dark band of fabric in the middle. the problem is that busty ladies will find the bust area wa I love this dress, it\\'s flattering and a nice a line cut that is comfortable to wear, however there are 2 issues with this dress as mentioned by others. the dress is cut at least 1 size too small and the zipper is very difficult. typically i\\'m a 0 in mauve and i went up to a 2 as the 0 doesn\\'t fit my (petite) rib cage. the zipper is annoying, but i can deal with it for the half off sale price i got with an additional 30% off.  i wouldn\\'t have purchased this dress if it were full price, however. Similar to others here, these pants were ruined after one wash. the first pair i bought simply faded after one wash, which was okay, but the second pair got weird splotches on the backside. i\\'d rather not call attention to that particular area of my body;) could\\'ve been a great addition to my wardrobe if they were better quality. Love the fit of the jeans just wish there was a couple more inches at the bottom:) these jeans have a 23 inch inseam not 26, so they hit at a very odd place on my calf- return. for reference i\\'m 5\\'8, I wanted to love this, was so excited when i ordered it online. the fabric (blue and white) was beautiful, but the cut was bad. it fit me like a maternity top, and made me look like i was 6 months along. i have a feeling that the models had theirs pinned back, in the back, because it does not lay flat like that in front, it has a lot of fabric with no place to go but up and out. returning. I received this dress in the mail yesterday. right away, i noticed the coloring wasn\\'t quite the same as it appears in the images online. in person, the hints of brown appear more bronzy and shiny, as opposed to more muted. i was willing to look past that, but then i tried it on. i ordered a small, which is my typical size in retailer dresses. it ran quite large and was way to long for me (i am 5\\' 4\\'\\'). overall, between the coloring and sizing, this dress wasn\\'t a hit for me. This coat is fun, flirty, & flattering. i bought it strictly for how good it looks on - it\\'s not a coat for warmth. the top is tailored and fitted, but the bottom is very full and swings. (there is a lot of fabric on the bottom). i\\'m not sure why some people had a hard time with the sleeves - i do not have the smallest arms and this was not an issue for me. however, i had a very thin shirt underneath the coat and that is all you can fit under it, so keep that in mind. the small fit me perfect. v Yikes!  quite a smell off of this one- like wet/hot wool.  the color was beautiful, but the sweater is enormous!  strange fit under the arms as well.  this one went back the same day. This dress is very versatile and flattering on-- i\\'ve already worn it out to casual cocktails with friends twice since i\\'ve gotten it. i\\'m 5\\'3 and 125 lbs and the 4 petite worked perfectly on me. The skirt is totally see through unless you wear a slip. even though it has a built in slip, it is still see through. the problem is that the slip is made out of the same super thin polyester material as the outside skirt. if it wasn\\'t see through i would keep it. I liked the concept of this vest, but when i tried it on, i felt like i was 9 years old again and wearing my brownies girl scout uniform. it was also very boxy and wide. it seemed to be well-made, though, and maybe would have worked if it were a different color. Dress is much different in person. thin ribbed cotton.  a little tight for xl.    it looks like a throw back dress from contempos.  returned and would not recommend I bought a pair of these a month ago and first time i washed them they came out with light spots all down the leg. i figured i did something wrong so i bought another pair in the same color and one in sage. just washed both pairs according to care instructions (no spills, stain remover, or anything but detergent) and both came out with light spots all down the leg. very sad to have wasted all that money. This sweater is exactly what you think it is. \\r\\n\\r\\ncomfy! \\r\\n\\r\\nit doesn\\'t have much shape (it\\'s pretty boxy), but that\\'s the point. it\\'s not one of those figure flattering kind, but it\\'s also not shabby looking. \\r\\n\\r\\nit\\'s so darn comfortable and soft and the colors are so upbeat and beautiful. \\r\\n\\r\\nsince it\\'s a fuzzy yarn type of fabric, i think the fuzz might start to fall out eventually and i have to be careful not to snag anything on it because i don\\'t want to pull the knitting loose. \\r\\n\\r\\nother t I love byron lars dresses, and this design is on-point. the ruffle at the neckline is so pretty, and the dress fits like a dream. however -- the fabric!!! i would have loved it if this dress had a heavier feel. this is, sadly, going back today. This dress really was huge, and not at all flattering. i don\\'t know how they got it to look good on the model in the picture. material was nice and soft, but i really don\\'t see how anyone could look good in this, no matter what your body shape is. This white shirt is very thin esp in the front and see through - i would have to wear a cami underneath unless i wanted people to see the outline of my bra. it seems very flimsy and poor quality, even at the sale price. disappointed and will return... Was excited for this shirt. i usually wear a medium to large depending on the cut and material, so i went with a medium. i was swimming in it. definitely recommend ordering a size below your normal. I\\'m on the shorter (5\\'\\'3\") side of the spectrum and usually wear an xs in retailer. this is a lovely suit but it didn\\'t work at all for me. it might work well on a taller person or someone who is longer waisted. the ruching and fuller cut leg was not flattering on me at all. it was very tight and pinched. sadly, i returned it. This dress is gorgeous. i purchased it recently to wear to my civil wedding ceremony and it is absolutely perfect. it is light, flowy, and comfortable, but the details make it special. the sheer sleeves give it ethereal vibe that i love. the quality seems to be extremely high as well. if you are looking for a white dress that is casual, but still unique and beautiful, please give this one a shot. i cannot wait to wear it on my special day! This is an adorable basic & i should have been wearing it once a week this summer, but instead the fabric developed noticeable holes after the very first wear. this brand makes some of the softest, cutest tees, but unfortunately more often than not are unwearable after the first or second wash. i wash on gentle & hang dry. not worth the cost. This top is very cute, but i found it runs small in the bust, which is unusual for maeve. i will have to return it. you may want to size up, if you have a generous bust. I wanted to love this product so badly. i ordered it in the mail, and it looked beautiful coming out of the box. i normally look really nice in grey, but this color really washed me out and was not nice on. the fabric is very sheer, so you would have to wear it over a camisole/tank top. this is one of those pieces that looks better on the hanger than in person. large in arms, small on body. odd fit. This top when pulled out of the box didn\\'t look like much, the contrast of the buttons, wrinkly, shapeless... but, when i shook it out, tried it on i fell in love. it\\'s so simple and versatile. prob the best white shirt i purchased this year, i\\'d say it pretty flowly, but that\\'s the style and i love it. i am 5\\'8\\'\\' 128lbs and purchased a small. i would purchase again, and in other colors if they had them. I wanted to love this dress, however it has no shape to it. it is also somewhat see through, so something needs to be worn under it. i feel like i received a dress that has been stretched out and returned. i\\'m extremely disappointed. i do not recommend. I tried on a l and found it incredibly unflattering on a large chest, as the waist hits a bit high.\\r\\nthe color is vibrant...i wanted to like! Very comfortable, fit over my muscle-y and flabby arms! very pretty. I thought that it looked like it belonged on a 15 year-old. i can almost see why they styled the model in what looks like ankle socks....ready for cheerleading. for reference it fits true to size, but is very short. i am 5\\'2\" and tried on a regular small - it was at least 5 inches above my knee. This jumper is so much more flattering than it appears in the product photo! i am not sure why it was paired in a way that made it look so wintery- and did not play up on the capri length and interesting artsy top! \\r\\n\\r\\ni am a curvy 4 or a 6, smaller on top, with hips. i love this fit. it it pulls in at a high waist, with a stretch in the pants---it\\'s just adorable! i would say that the top portion is quite fitted- it\\'s not a stretchy material, more of a textured thick fabric- so that is somethin These shorts are just beautiful. with that said, they were expensive, but made reasonable when i snagged them in the online sale! they do also run large, and they seem to be made for short-waisted bodies. i will be bringing them back to my local store to (hopefully) exchange for a smaller size. fingers crossed that they still have them in stock! A serious joke. i struggled with the buttons for a good 10 minutes and gave up after the 3rd button. i\\'m not sure what they were thinking. Within 2 washings the color faded to a not so black black, like a pair of pants that has been washed over a year\\'s use. after 5 or so washes the hook and eye closure began to fall off. the pants fit well, albeit a bit short (i\\'m 5\\'9\") and they run small. i sized up to a 6, when i usually am between a 2 or 4. i let the hem out, sewed the hook and eye closure back on and redyed them, and now they are good to go, but for nearly $90 i don\\'t expect to have to do this much work. these are not my first This top runs 2 full sizes large. had to send back and didn?t want to bother with getting a new one. I rarely write a really negative review and retailer is my favorite store ever. but this dress is awful. i ordered the black and white. the fabric is very poor quality. the colors are washed out. i almost didn\\'t try it on, but i did and found that, for me, the fit was terrible (though some of the reviewer pictures are cute). Bought this dress without trying it on but listened to the previous reviews saying this ran small and wow does it. i usually wear a 6 but ordered an eight which was hard to get on even with the upsizing. i do have a 34ddd bust so i do have a difficult time when dresses have no stretch over give in that area. overall beautiful dress, fabric is not stretchy which killed it for me. I love this dress because it\\'s so comfortable and has this hippie peasant vibe that i don\\'t generally wear. plus it\\'s a three season dress with pockets! bought the medium but i should have sized down to a small. on top i\\'m a m/l girl and the medium is huge. i\\'m not going to exchange since i wear a sweater over it right now. this dress looks good with or without a belt, with long boots, booties and sandals. so happy with this purchase! Despite retailer\\'s claim that they have \"fixed\" the button issue on this coat, beware. they haven\\'t. i ordered this coat november 18th, feeling safe that the issue that scores of other reviewers had noted was fixed, because retailer indicated \"rest assured, this issue has been fixed\" (as noted in the item description). feeling confident that i\\'d get a non-defective coat at this late date in the quality assurance cycle, i was severely disappointed to open my shipment tonight (nov 24th) immediately di I got this sweater in navy and it is much cuter than online! it is a great transition sweater and also i can see it used on cool nights at the beach. i have worn in professional environment to work as well as with a tee and jeans. i love it! It looks great on the model but not on me. on me, it looked more like a sack of potatoes. the fabric is unexpected for the style in my opinion. it is very thick. i\\'ll be returning it because it is not flattering on me. Love the movement of the blouse and how it falls. great quality material. Tried this in store today and id say it is exactly as pictured (length is similar on me at 5\\'7\", colors as shown, cut is loose but not overly sacklike). my normal size s fit loosely, but not in an unflattering way. sizing down might have been too narrow in the shoulders. the embroidery seemed to be good quality, but the fabric itself was on the thinner side with no lining. i would have liked to see a liner at this price (and probably would have bought), but i think i\\'ll wait for a promo or sale I bought this skirt in my usual xxs petite and the waist was way too small. i could not even pull the skirt all the way up. returned This is a beautiful dress! not too interested in yellow but needed it for a wedding this summer. i usually wear a large but returned it for a medium - the large armhole was a little too big. super comfortable and easy. This dress is very pretty and would be nice for a summer wedding. you will need to go braless or wear a strapless bra. i am sending it back because as it runs very small. i am a 34a and the size 2 was too snug across the top. I am a pretty curvy girl and thought the m/l was gigantic. i returned and was afraid to exchange for the smaller size thinking it would pbly be very large as well. it was not flattering because it was so boxy. This is cuter in person, more of a brown than a cream like in the picture. it runs a little smaller than i was expecting, but that\\'s actually good for me as things usually are a little loose up top. i\\'m 5\\'6\", 120 lbs, 32c, and an xs fit well for a sexier look, but if you\\'re wanting it a little looser, i would go up one size. I love this sweater coat! the buttons make it more structured and practical when the weather is cool.\\r\\nthe colors are even nicer in person; the neutral yellow is sure to compliment a lot.\\r\\nyou would be disappointed with this purchase. I was so impressed with the quality of this top that i bought it in all the colors.. it is comfy and thin. i purchased my usual size . it is so adorable with the lattice stripe.. They were ok pants but too small. the texture and shape were not what i expected either. I love the idea of this shirt, but the execution is absolutely horrible. i ordered online and what i received is just a mess. the stitching at the bottom has big globs of black thread. not just a few hanging off, but literally big clumps. a large portion of the stitching on the whole shirt looks like it should be on the underside of the shirt as the where the thread is tied off is on the outside!! the fit is just as big a mess. i always have to buy a large in fitted shirts because i have very br I was really excited to get this top but unfortunately its going to have to go back. i am 5\\'6 120 and usually a s fits. however, this was really tight. also, the material is really really thin for the $90 price-tag. save yourself some money and avoid this one. I absolutely loved this dress and when i received it, it was exactly the way it looked/fit online. the material is so pretty and the fit was amazing. it was a bit wrinkled, but i\\'m used to ironing things, so that didn\\'t bother me. unfortunately, i had to return it though because of the color. i\\'m filipino, and this yellow just isn\\'t flattering on someone with dark/tan skin. yellow is a tricky color for me to begin with, but this was more of a mustard yellow and just totally wrong for my coloring I ordered a large, and was hopeful that this would be as comfy and stylish as others reviewed. for me, it was not. it ran a little small on top, buttons bulged at my chest, and was hard to put on. bottom part fit well (although flattened my butt unflatteringly). i\\'m sure this works for some, just wasn\\'t the right fit for me. sent it back. I bought this top in two colors because i need more statement tops and thought the colors were different enough for a really great top. i have only worn the ivory so far and love it. comfortable, great style and solid quality so the fringe isn\\'t fraying or falling out.\\n\\nif i could change one thing it would be the itchiness around the neck opening. it\\'s not horrible but it can be distracting and mildly uncomfortable.\\n\\ni am really happy with the tops and can\\'t wait to start wearing the black one t This skirt is very short. i ordered my usual xs petite and it was so short that the longest part ended above my ankle. that\\'s quite off because i\\'m only 5 feet tall, and i wore it pretty low on the hips. it also flares out awkwardly below the knee. there are 2 vertical seems and they exacerbate the jagged appearance of the hem. i was drawn to the edgy style shown in the photo but in person it looks like my 5 year old cut up a skirt. plus, the fabric--while thick and beautiful and stretchy--has a I wanted to like this one.. really but it was just plain sloppy looking. i returned it. Just, you know, in front of my mirror and around the house. i bought this piece because i found it to be a bit funky - so you can wear it with jeans for a night out - yet with classic elements so it could be worn to work with a skirt. also, i live in florida, where it is hot hot hot, but i still like to layer my look. it has an excellent weight to it without being to heavy, so it flows well and can be worn even on the warm days instead of a suit jacket. \\r\\n\\r\\ni am usually between a small and mediu On me, this top is totally frumpy and boxy. i am 5\\'9, 34dd and the bottom hung on me like a bedskirt. not fitted at all. i ordered a large--not being sure of fit. i have a flat stomach and it just hung....yuck. honestly, for the price and fit, i wouldn\\'t consider a medium. i think it would a tad better but not worth the price. Cute enough, but i couldn\\'t figure out what to do with the tie that didn\\'t make it look like an extra set of sleeves, oddly placed. High quality, and worth full price.... but way too small. also a bit short in the torso. This blouse is stunning on the website ;however, it is totally sheer which you cannot tell from the photo. i was very disappointed and will be returning. I\\'m keeping these shorts because they are cute. i sized down as the previous reviews suggested and they fit great, but they are snug around the legs. i think i would have preferred a more baggy look, but then they would have been too big around the waist (had i ordered my typical size). they are soft and comfortable, the navy color is really pretty. I was so excited to get this dress. i saw someone try it on in the store and waited all season for it to go on sale. i loved it except for the seam that was right at the neckline in the front. they didn\\'t even try to match up the fabrics. it was so obvious and cheap looking that i had to send this dress back. so sad! I bought the neutral color. this is a lightweight tunic sweater that can be worn during spring. the lace detail is so pretty...i ordered my normal size small and would have preferred an extra small...the top flows nice but would\\'ve been a better overall fit if i sized down. i\\'m 5\\'7 140 lbs for reference. make sure you size down at least 1 size. Cute and very soft, but the elastic wasn\\'t sewn in right. i took them out of the wash and the waistband was a twisted mess. disappointing for more expensive loungewear. I loved the design online but the sweater is bulky and boxy. i had chosen the cream with blue and now looking back at the other pictures of the beige/cream it represents it better. it made me look very wide. loved it online but it wasn\\'t for me, returned it. I love the material & flow of the bottom half of this dress, it fits like a charm.  for reference i am a 34-29-38/39, the size 6 was spot on. that being said, i was a little disappointed by the top portion of the dress; the dolman sleeve seems odd & the faux wrap is gaping & doesn\\'t seem to clip in the right spot, sloppy, not like on the model. the dress would be perfect as a full sleeve & a little snugger of a wrap. i could alter the top, but the material just wouldn\\'t lay right to the waist. A great long line bra! beautiful and well made however it\\'s tough to get the fit perfectly right. i usually wear a 32 b or 34 a and am 115lbs. the small was the best fit as the 32 (xs) was a very small 32. i could almost say it more of a 30 if that\\'s even a size. it also rubs my skin few places so definitely not meant to be worn for more than a few hours. otherwise i recommend it! The fabric on this shirt was beautifully woven and so soft/cozy. but the shirt was so wide! i\\'m 5\\'2\", 103lbs and got an xs. there was room for two of me in there. it draped very well, but instead of looking slouchy and cool, it just looked too big. so, back it goes. I did not like this top at all-but had i looked at the fabric prior to purchasing i would not have. it is polyester-i thought it was cotton so there\\'s the first reason i didn\\'t like it. secondly, there is a piece of fabric behind the laces, presumably for modesty that refuses to lay flat. it wrinkles up behind the lacing, making it appear as if one is wearing an undershirt or cami that is not appropriate for the top. it is too long for me, the top hitting at top of thigh.\\r\\nthis top is just reall The picture makes the shorts look structured. i assumed they were made of a heavier cotton material. i was disappointed when they turned out to be a light weight polyester. \\r\\n\\r\\nalso, this runs way too big. i am busty and did not fill out the top of the xs.\\r\\n\\r\\ni wouldn\\'t even buy this at the sale price. They are beautiful! they fit amazingly! they ripped on a seam the third time i wore them. i kept wearing them, because again, the fit! the style! alas, about the fifth time i wore them, the other leg ripped at the knee seam. they are just totally falling apart. it\\'s so very sad. i would wear them alllll the time if they could bear it. i\\'m actually thinking of buying another pair because i love them soooo, but it would likely be wasted cash as i believe there is a real manufacturing issue here. w I loved the look of this tunic. it is made well and very pretty. it was so big and heavy i had to return it. i think the small in this would be too big. The bra is comfortable and the design is good. however, the sizing is way off. i am a 34c and the small fits well with minimal support. not sure about quality. this one might have to go back :( The dress is not the beautiful color in the picture...it is a very yellowish cream. the fabric is thick and does not\\r\\nhang pretty. very disappointed. had to return it. I order the blue and orange endora wing dress in an xxs and it was still very large. i know that this is a flow dress but there was so much excess material that i looked like i was swallowed. the colors are more muted than in the pictures, a faded blue and orange that i didn\\'t really like. return. I tried on this jumpsuit in black and it was absolutely beautiful. i liked that it looked sort of like a tuxedo, i wore it one time and received so many compliments. when i washed it, however, it shrunk almost 1 size! the pant legs were high water. i even tried washing and restretching it because i loved the jumpsuit but it wouldn\\'t budge, i think because rayon is not stretchable material. to my disappointment, i returned it. i really wished it would have worked out. This sweater is great i bought the black version on sale. my complaint is the pulling factor though. you don\\'t expect retailer sweaters to pill after a couple wears. overall i love the fit and look though so i continue to overlook it and use my sweater comb as needed! I carefully read the reviews and decided to order a medium since that size works for me generally with floaty styles. the neck was a bit small but once over my head it fit and looked nice. the deal breaker for me is the huge droopy armholes that showed half my bra. the colors are deeper than shown. but the pattern and length overwhelmed my shape feeling a lot like a maternity top. i liked that the sides are shorter but overall it\\'s just not my style. better suited i think for taller, slimmer bod True to the verdugo style. love the fit, stretch but holds shape...super comfy! This top runs very large. i am a size 12/14 & purchased the size l. i could have easily fit in the size m. it\\'s a pretty top in a comfortable knit fabric , but the size was overwhelming so i returned it. I was so so excited to get this sweater in the mail. unfortunately, the sweater is lined with the same material (very soft and warm btw) as the polka dots, which sheds like crazy. i wore a white tshirt under this for the first time, and my shirt was covered in black fuzz by the end of the day. so much so that i was gathering balls of it to be thrown away. very disappointed. a lint roller can\\'t even clean up the tshirt.\\n\\nin terms of sizing, this fits tts, i normally wear a l or xl, got this in an This is a beautifully made dress and i couldn\\'t wait to put it on. i was disappointed. i am 5\\'5\" and a size 4- 6. i ordered the 6 and it was too \\'long and heavy\\' looking on me. but the waist and upper body fit tightly. the zipper up the back was very heavy looking and the cut away shoulders didn\\'t work for my body type, making me look bulky on top. the torso is really built for someone with small breasts - i am average and the way the darts are, made my breasts look flatter and lower than they a Pilcro from retailer is a great alternative to the premium denim lines with a way better price point! similar cut & quality with awesome rises and spandex/stretch content! also, the styles are always on trend! I loved this dress from the moment i tried it on. so flattering to my postpartum body without being a huge tent. soft fabric, and for a white/lightly striped dress, not sheer. i\\'m bummed because after washing only twice (followed the instructions to wash) on gentle cycle and low tumble dry, holes started appearing everywhere, both on the cream ribbed hem in the front bottom and all across the chest, in the white part of the fabric only (it looks like the black stripes are holding the holes toget No need to be on the fence about this top, it\\'s lovely! what you see pictured here, is exactly what you get, even the color of the top is 100% accurate. for reference i\\'m usually an xl/16, apple shape, 40 c bust, and this xl does not cling at all to me, so you may even be able to size down. the drape of the clipdot fabric is flattering, and thick enough not to need a cami. all of the fabrics used are nice and soft... and the details! it\\'s going to be a beautiful spring! This dress is made of a wonderful, thick material that is flattering. i think the photo doesn\\'t really bring it to life- it\\'s a great dress that can dressed up and is at least a 3 season dress thanks to the colors. the v-neck is a little deep if you are bustier but not inappropriate for a slightly more casual office. it runs a bit large and the fabric has some give so i would potentially size down. i also think if you are more narrow shouldered it might not be the best fit without a nip and tuck I love jumpsuits for their style and comfort. i loved the look of this blue silky piece, and the review that said it was like lounge wear you could wear out of the house. i agree that it is like lounge wear, but for me, there were a few challenges.\\r\\n\\r\\nfirst, the fit was small. i am usually anywhere between a 2 and a 6 depending on style, cut and brand. i tried the small in this and it was not a flowy look or feel. it was restrictive in the hip area in a way that would make me not want to wear th I wanted to love this top to go with a pair of red flats i also bought at retailer. but it\\'s almost like a peplum crop top because the cut is short. the peplum piece also flares out rather dramatically. had to return it even though i love other tops from maeve. Size 0 ordered .they fit beautifully for the first 2 hours but slowly stretched out and lost their shape sadly. Absolutely love this jacket!! i convinced my girlfriend to get one too; we could not be more pleased. slightly oversized throughout the body - this is true no matter the size you buy - with great contrasting sleeves and back. the side ribbons can be adjusted to bring in or let out the waist. perfect spring/summer weight. can be worn with a sweater/sweatshirt underneath. it\\'s a feminine takeover of a boyfriend jacket - looks gorgeous over a casual dress or great with jeans/chinos. perfect for mus If you have any cleavage this dress will look awful. the ties drop pretty low & look trashy over cleavage. recommend otherwise - good fabric cool look This blouse is pretty sheer, but perfect for a summer day. good coverage in the front and under arms on the sides for limited bra exposure, and a very cute opening in on the lower back. Bought this early in the season - probably washed and worn <8 times and there are small holes that have formed in the front towards the bottom...bummer! I didn\\'t realize that there were sequins on the design. they kept poking my shoulders and made the top very uncomfortable. the white material was also not very flattering on me. it went back. While the fabric, embroidery and sizing are dead on, i just couldn\\'t deal with the shiny little mirrors that the designer embellished this shirt with. that detail is not apparent in the photographs and i felt lessened the versatility of this blouse. so, it must go back to retailer. Absolutely loved this top but after i washed it the underside color ran at the stitching. it is all white on the outside but at the bottom hem it has a really cool 1\" lining in a mustard color. i did a cold water wash and flat to dry. i noticed around the stitching at the bottom the mustard color has bled through just at the area of the mustard color stitching. \\r\\n\\r\\ni am so disappointed b/c i loved this top. I ordered the lavender version in xl. it fit me as shown on the model so i think it runs true to size. it is a little shorter than shown. it hits my waist & i\\'m 5 ft. 5 1/2 in. for reference. it fits close through the arms & body but with a comfortable, stretchy material. a tank underneath is needed. i love the draping. it\\'s very flattering. the color is more of a gray than purple. i took the chance on it when it was on sale and it\\'s now a favorite. great neckline for wearing necklaces too. Cute, but very itchy! have to wear a long sleeve tee underneath! Putting my two cents in regarding how fantastic this dress is! i bought the medium petite in navy stripe. it fits great, it\\'s not too clingy and it\\'s flattering to my disproportionate figure (makes me look more hourglass). Just a warning, the yoke on this dress has sequins underneath. i\\'m not a sparkle kinda gal, so as soon as i saw that, the dress went right back in the package and will be going back to the store. i wish that had been described or more evident in the pictures, to me, it cheapens the whole dress, which would otherwise be adorable. I ordered this in a 4 (34b, 140lbs., 5\\'8\") because it looked like it would run big, and it definitely does! the 4 fit comfortably but the cut of this dress made me look about 10 lbs. heavier than i am. i am pear-shaped and this dress made me look very bottom heavy, so i returned it. that said, the material is gorgeous!, as it is the perfect weight and the colors are much more striking and complementary in person. if i had a straight(er) silhouette and a larger bust, this dress would have been a Got this in the moss color. i throw on a hoodie almost every day to walk my dog so i justified the high price. returned it because it was not cute on. the waffle fabric didn\\'t stand out, and the bottom just hung straight. i thought it would be more ruffle-like. even on sale i won\\'t buy it ~ it\\'s just that blah So disappointed. bought these in a 29 and should\\'ve gone with a 28. they\\'re super cute - i got the green. the fit is off. like the other reviews, they stretch out way too much. i would return these but have already washed them. they wash terribly, too. there are weird fading marks all over, even when washed in cold water like the tag states. so disappointed that i spent my gift card from christmas on these. i\\'ve been a loyal retailer customer for years and this is the first time i\\'ve been severely Dress looks awesome when your arms are down like the model. but don\\'t you dare lift your arms. i\\'m kinda tall and the dress barely covers my bum when arms are raised. keeping the dress but will have to keep my arms down ;) maybe? I wanted to love this dress, but sadly i will be returning. the color looked fairly different in person than on the model. i thought it was a browner/neutral hue, but the dress is almost like a yellow seersucker-ish with brownish moth printing. was cuter than expected! the sweetheart neckline is darling, but that is where it fit me poorly. i have a 34c bust, and the cups of the size 4 were gaping on me in the front and all along the arm holes. the straps were also way too long and falling off my I purchased these on sale. one thing to say, i had to return the first pai r (xs) as there was a missing section of stiching on the sema, creating a whole you can\\'t really fix neatly. so i ordered a new pari. i usually like petite, but regular size was fine, they jsut end up being to the ankle (longer), not bunchy. i also ordered xxs peite to compare, but that was smaller on waist, almost not comfortable), and the laced-up part looked a little weird/overstretched. i have not used htem to work ou I loved the material\\'s texture and drape, but it was too sheer for me. i am 100% against having to wear a tank under white tees. (which means i have a lot of trouble finding any white tees, but...) \\r\\n\\r\\nother than the see-through nature, i loved this shirt! Normally, hd in paris brand is spot on for their dresses. this dress is a big thumbs down. as most of these reviewer\\'s and myself point out, the large arm holes do not allow you to wear a regular bra because you don\\'t just get a peak of your bra, you get to see the whole side of it. secondly, the bust of the dress would work only for an a-cup bra, too small for the average woman. the only bright spot with this dress is the brilliant colors available and the quality of the fabric itself - excelle I am 5\\'3\\' and 120 lbs for reference, and pear shaped and this dress in a 4 petite fit like a glove. granted, not a dress i would want to gain weight in, but fit perfectly. usually i am a 2 in retailer dresses but read other reviews and definitely made the right choice. it hits at a very flattering length even for someone as short as i am. Dress was a disappoint. very thin and cheaply made, not worth the money at all. pictures make it look much better than in real life. top area is also made small so if you are busty, this is not the dress for you. I saw this online and went to the store to try it on. so glad i did! it did not work on me at all! it is so wide - just did not look right. it was also not flattering at the neckline either. i thought it was beautiful until i had it on! too bad - wanted to love it! Legs are too wide. the fabric is rough to the touch. Great idea, but this was not a flattering top on me. it almost worked, but ended up making me look like i am pregnant?not a look i am striving to achieve?it has potential and maybe others with a different body type may have success. ( i am curvy on bottom and have a long torso) for the price, it did not justify a place in my closet? I don\\'t know who this would fit. looks so cute on the model and i thought this was going to be the perfect between season dress . . . but just looked like a sack! i think the \"knit\" must have stretched into an unnatural shape - especially the arms! I love this t-shirt. i fabric is soft yet has a nice weight to it. it is comfortable, yet sexy. Interesting, slightly transparent fabric. neckline is not so open as pictured. body is boxier than pictured.\\r\\nwould recommend as a maybe. This  is more of a cover up than something you would wear out . Runs small. i\\'m usually a size sm for retailer clothing (for reference, i\\'m 5\\'4, 129lbs, 36b). the tie around the waist of this dress is not a functional tie that you can relax a bit to give yourself more room around the waist. i could not fasten the buttons to close the dress on the size 8. the size 10 fit enough to fasten the buttons but there was a lot of extra fabric and the arm holes were very large. pretty, vibrant colors but size up and be warned of the large armholes. Bought this in white and the golden embroidery makes this piece very elegant looking. it is a bit sheer, but with a lace bra definitely very nice. that is the only con, i wish it would be not sheer at all. but it is too beautiful to send it back for that reason. I tried this shirt and really loved the feel, and the scalloped sleeves. i have a couple shirts by this brand that also have beautiful embroidery, and i always find myself drawn to their clothing. the fit wasn\\'t too boxy on me, but i\\'m between m&l, and sized down, so that might have helped. if i didn\\'t have so much of this color in my wardrobe already i probably would have snatched this up! The shirt is very big. it would be cute as a maternity shirt. I own two poodles and love anything poodle print. i was estatic to see this and i snagged it on sale. but it is horrible. the fit is like wearing a pillowcase. it was about 5 inches too wide on each side while the arms fit. it looked like it was attempting to have a dolman shape but it was way too short, wide, and wrong. i was in love with the print however i had to return it. This skirt is beautiful. fabric is gorgeous,with perfect amount of shine and luxury to it. there is a \"life \"in this skirt; it is well made and follows the body lines in a perfect way. or,i better say, it did fit me perfectly first ten minutes of wearing it. unfortunately, it stretched more than a full size, and generally lost its shape. now, the skirt is two sizes too large and not really wearable anymore. I was wondering whether to purchase this top and decided last weekend during the 20% off event, i would splurge!!! i got the m as i\\'m tall (5\\'10\") and it does look a little strange on the arms atleast on my body. the sleeve is cut too high for me. i wish it was longer or even a long-sleeved item! the peach-apricot- nude colored fabric is a little uncomfortable and the fabric close to the neck is a different grey from the other sweatshirt pieces. the sweatshirt pieces aren\\'t particularly soft eit I love the teal color of this t-shirt and the macrame design at the top is beautiful, however, the top is way too large.  i usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops, so i ordered the size s, there is so much fabric below the chest it fits like a maternity top.  i know if i order an xs, i will have the same problem.  below the bust, the top is not flattering and it&amp;#39;s a shame. Tried on this maxi dress recently, hoping i would have a new dress to enjoy but the frabic is just too thin. so sad :(. unfortunately it shows every lump and bump and even wearing spanx while trying on it still showed too much. a full length slip would help but i decided to put it back. I truly cannot understand the great reviews on this dress!  i purchased in both a sp and a mp.  i am 5\\'2\" 120#.  the mp fit perfectly.  i definitely wouldn\\'t keep it though because it looks like someone sewed a bunch of old sweatshirts together.  it\\'s not super soft, coarse on the inside, and feels old.  the back is longer than the front, it just looks like something my daughter would make in sewing class out of scraps.  even with leggings and great boots, it looks worn. I was on the fence about keeping but the more i tried it on, the more i liked it. i feel like it will be a great winter casual top the reason i was on the fence was because its pretty big. i\\'m 5\\'4 and 108 and the xs is pretty voluminous on me. it\\'s just so darn different and feminine though that i\\'m going to live with the fact that there is so much material. i think it is still cute. the fabric is also really soft on the inside so it will be cozy too. You have to be a contortionist to get this bra on. it slips over your head and i needed my 8yo daughter to help me pull it down past my elbows. ridiculously impractical. why oh why didn\\'t heather give it a hook and loop closure instead? This sweater looks way better in person than in this picture. the secret: try the petite size. loses a star for not having seamed edges , so it might fray or unravel easily-- but of course that clean unseamed cut looks super cute, especially around the neck. also a bit spendy. but let me say again: super cute on. Ok so when i bought this in every color there were no negative reviews. i loved this shirt. it was amazing. fit perfect was so comfortable. then i washed it. ahhhh. it shrunk so bad my3 year old could wear it. i washed it according to the tag. then the second color i just hand washed in ice cold water and laid flat and it still shrunk. man. i wish i could return these shirts. they are so bad. and i typically love bordeaux quality. these are horrendous. I like this dress. i did have to return one for a regular from a petite size 8. normally i wear a size 6 in retailer dresses but since i have a large bust (34dd) i wanted to account for the needed room. with the petite the bust was not so much a problem as the ribcage, which was too tight. it is still fitted in the regular size 8, but doable. the 6 would have been impossible. i am aware that i have a slightly larger ribcage so i was not completely surprised. the other reason that i did not give th Beautiful sweater!! i love the color and the fit. the cowl neck isn\\'t too tight and the sweater hangs away from the body without being boxy. it comes down to the low hip on me. very soft and cozy. i purchased the aqua in xs. fits perfectly and i\\'m 5\" 5\\' 127lbs. The material is cheap and looks torn. not as nice as the picture. I\\'m a bit disappointed in this top. i\\'m keeping because retailer\\'s shipping rates are obnoxious and i don\\'t have a store near me. by the time i pay for shipping both ways, i could have paid for 1/2 the shirt. the loft has some very similar tops for about 1/2 the price. i love meadow rue, and their material is fabulous, but the design is off on this one. you can\\'t size down because the armholes and top are fitted, but the bottom is a tent. not my usual style, as i\\'m short, with a short waist. this Since this sold out so fast i ordered an xsp which is too short (i\\'m 5\\'5\"), it also is too big! the empire waist has no shape or flatter, the sleeves are huge, the neckline was falling off my shoulder, i put it on and instantly knew this was all wrong.   the print is very fun and my guess is that\\'s what is attracting everyone to it.  it looked like a big floppy mess of cute fabric on me.  back it goes. This tank is not very flattering. there is a lot of fabric, it\\'s very boxy, & the holes kind of remind me of a high school basketball jersey. i even sized down and it\\'s still just wide. i\\'m returning :( Looks great in the picture but when i got this in the mail the fabric was so stiff! shaking it out did nothing-almost like it was dipped in drying glue. i got this for $10 which is so cheap and i still returned it! I absolutely loooove this skirt! its just as depicted. super comfy and warm. got tons of compliments wearing it. its just adorable. the colors are really rich and the design if the skirt made it avery flexible to wear with different styles of tops and sweaters. highly recommend!! This is a comfortable sweater dress, and the quality of the material seems good. the solid blue strip down the front makes it look very bland. i think it would need some dressing up with a necklace or scarf. i decided to pass. If you have a love for vintage, romantic, feminine attire, this is the dress for you. it evokes memory of days gone by. it isn\\'t just beautiful, the quality is superb. make sure you check the measurements for this little beauty has so stretch to it. I am a pretty curvy girl and thought the m/l was gigantic. i returned and was afraid to exchange for the smaller size thinking it would pbly be very large as well. it was not flattering because it was so boxy. It\\'s sheer, the design /print is casual, but on silk like material. had it been made out of cotton would have definitely kept it! who is going to wear this in the blazing heat of summer??? I got fooled by this dress\\'s description. it\\'s 100% polyester and not wool as it claims to be! looks cheap.returned it! This tunic looks awesome in the picture. however, it is made of an uncomfortable sweater-like material not left of centers normal skin cotton. i was disappointed once i saw this in person. not a great material for summer. Lovely print and colors. interior lining was so super soft, but it did lay right on me, felt very big and bulkly and i wasn\\'t a fan of the single snap closure, esp being so low, so i decided it was not for me at that price and returned. 5\\'5\", 135lbs, 34c and the s was too big. it is beautiful and i will consider the xs if the price is cut further. I am curvy and this top, while stylish and i love the pockets, just didn\\'t do it for me. it made my shoulders look wider than they are, which is a big no no. it would probably look better on someone with smaller shoulders or slimmer. the wool was also a tad itchy - not too itchy, just a bit. in general i don\\'t wear wool without cashmere, i also don\\'t wear non-italian wool because it is a bit rough and my skin reacts to it. so i stick to wool cashmere blend or loro piana soft wool. this sweater s I love the colors in this top. the black tie makes this top different from anything else in my closet. the cut accentuates my shoulders, which i like. i usually wear a petite small, so i ordered this in an extra small and it fits nicely. the fabric could be a bit softer, but i still really like this top. it\\'s unique and very feminine. The tights are thin and not how they appear in the photo. one of my pairs had a hole in the seat and it was obvious they had been repackaged with part of the packaging missing. very disappointing. i wish i had found the hole before i try them on. they are definitely going back. Cut out design, no seems or hems.\\r\\n very disappointed in retailer I love the pattern of the red/orange dress. i bought this online for easter. i\\'m bummed. i felt frumpy. the dress fit. i\\'m 5\\'5\" athletic build and i bought the xs. it is just not flattering on my frame. i looked like i had big hips, the waist band was not creating a waist for me and i need that... i wanted to keep it but sadly i will be returning it. my husband agreed i should return it. I have received so many compliments on this top from both men and women. it is so comfortable and cute, i never want to take it off. :p I love this shimmer tank-in both colors! it is a very thin fabric-thinner than i would have expected, but i think this is okay since i would use it for layering and probably never wear it as a standalone tank. i think you can never go wrong with sparkles, especially in a layering tank-it dresses up or fancies up the outfit. the straps on this tank are not adjustable, and if you are large chested, i think a lot of cleavage would show in this tank. i would have preferred the sleeves are very sligh Horrible fit not true to size again aline outside of the dress and a very tight camisole underneath I really want to like this dress - it\\'s beautiful, but it just fits like a sack. the yoke exaggerates my bust and the dress makes me look 20 lbs heavier. perhaps if you are tall and thin like the mode, or small chested, it would be great! the quality and color is beautiful. Based on other customer reviews, i ordered these trousers expecting a lightweight cropped pant that would be appropriate for spring and especially summer. however, the fabric is much heavier than what i\\'d usually wear in the summer . the cut of the trousers were superb though - i like a low-rise or hipster cut which these are.\\n\\nthey are fitted and not oversized like many of the other retailer items i buy, so if you are an xs these will be xs (or runs small for retailer clothing) if you like your clo I was able to get this on sale. when it arrived, it was missing half of the rhinestones. i am very surprised that this top would be sent out this way. it also was missing the little bag with extra stones. i\\'m reaching out and wondering if anyone else has experienced this and is there a store that sells rhinestones like the one on the blouse? any help from anyone would be appreciated. i hate to part with this, but where was quality control? This top was a big disappointment. i ordered two of the grey motif with the print of the forest animals in size 16. neither of them fit well, but one was cut much smaller than the other. i\\'ve had this problem with all of the numerically-sized buttondown style of maeve tops. i don\\'t understand why in size 14 & 16, this keeps happening. that\\'s why i purchase two of each. usually one fits and the other doesn\\'t. this time, unfortunately, neither worked. they both were too tight in the arms/shoulders Cute design with interesting details. i felt it ran a bit large. i\\'m 5\\'8\", 135 lbs, an 8 was too big and baggy. my biggest complaint with this skirt is the color. it\\'s just not flattering. Hahaha..this dress is hilarious! it looks nothing like the image! i am usually a 0/xs, and 4 was the smallest size available, so i ordered it. when i opened it, it felt like 10 lbs of fabric. i thought maybe i ordered a size way too big, until i could barely squeeze into the top of the dress. once i looked in the mirror, i almost fell over laughing. the rest of the dress is huge. i don\\'t believe this dress would be flattering on anyone. This dress is super cute, flattering and well made but it runs very small. i am usually a 6 so from other reviews i ordered an 8 and it is still tight in the hip area. it zips but the fabric pulls a bit in the front and it rides up when i walk. i am going to try and exchange it for a 10 because i think i\\'ll get lots of wear out of it. I bought the white with the colorful stripes. i am not disappointed. the sleeves are rolled and tacked. it seems to run a little big in the torso. all in all, a great summer tee. Love love the fit and material. a must fall wardrobe. I was intrigued by the pattern of this blouse (the purple version) but the design is terrible for me. it\\'s boxy, i didn\\'t like the fabric, and the arm ruffles are bizarre. it\\'s going back tomorrow. I\\'m 5\\'7, 125lbs, and the small fits perfectly. the sleeves are the right length (i have long arms and legs), and the body fits loosely, without looking sloppy. at my height, the small is not long enough to wear as a tunic, which is fine.\\r\\n\\r\\nunfortunately, the shirt arrived with makeup stains around the laces and the inside of the shirt, so i had to wash it before wearing it.\\r\\n\\r\\ni only purchased this shirt because it was on sale. I decided to take advantage of the free shipping despite seeing no reviews yet. i received the dress today and it is exactly as pictured, only about 3 inches shorter. i am usually between an xs and s but chose the xs because of late, everything i seem to order is huge. this was an exception and i could have ordered the s. color was as pictured, a nice green. fabric was a gauzy cotton. the dress was just \"alright\". nothing special to warrant the price tag. it felt like a little girl\\'s dress on me I love the way that this suit looked, however i found that it was lacking in support. i was disappointed to discover upon trying it on, that it just does not cover my butt. it fit elsewhere just fine, but the slim cut up the sides left it a little too revealing for my liking. in addition i found the top to be awkwardly fitting around the chest area. i am a 34b and ordered a small and it seemed to be too baggy at the top. I love boiled wool and have gotten a few items from retailer in years past that i have loved. this one was a fail. i typically wear a small and it was slightly too big and shapeless for me. i am 34c, 127#. the moment i put it on, it felt like i was wearing a bathrobe. it flares quite a bit, and the stitching is brown and not dark grey like i was hoping. the quality is as expected. the color overall is as it looks online. but it was a return. The cut is wonderful and the fabric is soft and flowy. it is pretty sheer so a slip is recommended. i wish this dress had a lining like some other dresses i\\'ve gotten at retailer. This top is absolutely beautiful. the fabric is great, the cut is nice, etc... however, the buttons are too big for the button loops, which do not have any stretch. it took ten minutes to open the shirt to try it on. once i had it on, i left it unbuttoned. i returned it. (if you can\\'t live without it, you could put smaller buttons on it.) too pricey for a non-functioning top. too bad. Okay, so this top has its redeeming qualities, i promise! which is why i gave it 3 stars when i really wanted to give it two. but it\\'s just not worth 2 because i\\'m sure it works for some people and the quality is just impeccable. for people who purchase this, it will last forever. it\\'s sturdy cotton, not thin like many retailer tee materials. the lace detail and texture is on point and the neckline is very nice. it\\'s a great looking top. my issue though, wasn\\'t with the bust as other reviewers hav I purchased this top online, love the off the shoulder trend and this looked like it would be perfect for fall. nice fabric and lace detail but the top definitely runs big! i ordered an xl and it was beyond swimming on me. definitely order a size or two down! also, it is very long / tunic length. i love a tunic but it almost wore more as a dress than a top! overall, cute item and fabric but definitely order down!! This is a great layering piece. took it on a trip and wore with both a long sleeve and tank under it. is more \\'khaki\\' color then the photo shows - which was a goo thing for me. I know rompers typically aren&amp;#39;t the easiest and while i loved this fabric this was a pain to put on no zipper, etc. and the buttons are tiny and since the fabric doesnt stretch it is difficult to even try on. the length of the shorts was great and the fit was just ok all in all i don&amp;#39;t think it is worth the price. I got this top planning to wear it with the sleeves up rather than off the shoulder, like in one of the photos. my regular size (medium) was way too large so i went down to a small. however, the collar was still too wide for the sleeves to stay above my bra straps. back it goes. if you\\'re looking for a strictly off-the-shoulder top, you might like it. color is deep blue and the cotton is a nice weight. I gulped when i put this in my bag during retailer days because the price was still too much but thought this has to be wonderful to charge so much, right? boy was i wrong. this is a sweater knit with a very deep v-neck that\\'s incredibly boxy and unattractive. the knit shed all over my pants in the few minutes i had it on. i ordered in xl, having never tried this designer and that was a mistake because i generally wear large or medium. it was swimming on me. the stripes aren\\'t as cute in real life I ordered my usual size small in this top (34c) and it just fits across the chest. very cute top. I wrote item ran large, but that was true only in length. it would be long for someone 5\\'10\" . however the bigger issue is getting it on. the style and quality are quite nice, but it does have some issues. I would have to wear a camisole underneath this, which is odd considering it\\'s still two layered in the front. i wanted an easy white shirt to wear, not something i\\'d have to layer. I am not a bright clothing person but adore this top. if this is the right red for you i highly recommend.! it is a beautiful bright red no orange tones so really works with my skin tones. it is a very comfy shirt and although it is a stretchy fabric it did not show any lumps or bumps in the upper back. has a beautiful flow to it and looks not only great with jeans but really cute with a patterned sweater pencil skirt i bought at retailer a couple years ago and always with a good old black pencil I really was excited to get this dress. the design is great. very nice quality. it does seem to run small on me in the booty/belly area. that or it is just tighter than my liking. overall it is a nice dress. i plan to get a mint cardigan to top it off and a thin cognac leather belt. Beautiful sweater that looks great with jeans. I didn\\'t end up keeping this dress...it just wasn\\'t right for me. it is very cute and fit well but the fabric was very thin (partially lined which is a plus) and the hem line coming up on the sides made it just too short for me. i ordered the petite xs and liked the length in front and back well but the side slit/vent was just too high for my liking. the tie part hit at the perfect spot for me at only 5\\'4\" (~118#). i guess i just didn\\'t \"love\" it and would rather save my funds for something i ca So disappointed in the abundance of polyester fabrics that retailer carries these days. especially at this price point. the pattern and style of this dress is beautiful, but i will never spend two hundred dollars (or even half that) on a poly dress. please add more linen, cotton, and silk! I really feel in love with the details of these joggers and they did not fail me when they arrived. i haven\\'t worn them yet but tried them on and they seem like nice little relaxed wear with a tee shirt. i can see them being worn with a cami in warm weather or a relaxed tee shirt in a variety of colors. all in all , very versatile , and i recommend them. I wanted to love this top. the color is wonderful in the pink and the material is silky soft. it is huge though, i am a 34 dd and bought my usual small! i am going to exchange for an xs and am hoping it fits. The romper was really quite and looks just like the picture. quality felt good too. but when i tried it on the sleeves just didn\\'t look right on me. they were too long and too big. for that reason i decided to return it. Great for lounging or running errands. can be dressed up or down. i found them to run at least a size large though. Super cute pants, fit and color just like model picture. i fall between a 28 and 29 waist, and all that was available was a 29; so i ordered it online. however, when they came it was just a bit too big/loose so i had to return them. if i had been able to get just the right size (maybe size own a bit if in questions) i think i would have kept them. I ordered two colors of these in 25p.  i am keeping them because they feel wonderful on, but they definitely have to be hemmed! i measured the inseam on both pairs to be closer to 29 inches.  29 inches is not a petite length. I was extremely disappointed with the quality of this product. as soon as i put this tunic, the right tie loop detached from the garment. i could return it but the point of shopping online was to avoid the hassle of going to the store. the price of the item does not justify the low quality of the final product. This top is absolutely beautiful. the fabric is great, the cut is nice, etc... however, the buttons are too big for the button loops, which do not have any stretch. it took ten minutes to open the shirt to try it on. once i had it on, i left it unbuttoned. i returned it. (if you can\\'t live without it, you could put smaller buttons on it.) too pricey for a non-functioning top. too bad. I ordered this tee despite the price. the fabric is very thin and the quality was poor. nice concept for a tee, but failed in quality and value. it was returned. Love this shirt and the details on the collar. I tried this on at the store in black. the lace on the back is gorgeous and the fabric is very soft, but i would disagree with the previous reviews - i don\\'t think this is flattering on all body types. i\\'ve got an hourglass figure and the top absolutely robs you of a waist. it drapes straight down on the front, so if you have a larger chest, you end up looking like a football player.\\n\\ni think for a narrow frame or a smaller chest, this would be very flattering. The color, design and fabric of this top (got it in the red) were just as i expected, but as the owner of several deletta brand tops, i was very surprised to find that my usual size small runs very large in this tank. not only did the front dip too low but so did the arm holes, and the top just hangs on me. it was so big for a small that it almost made me think it had been mislabeled and was really a size large. \\r\\nbummed to return it because i really love the color and the style. will try an x-s I got this sweater with high hopes to wear it with some leggings for christmas. it looked adorable (and long!) on the model. however, it doesn\\'t even cover my butt, that\\'s how short it is. if you\\'re anything over 5\\'4\", i\\'d say it\\'ll be too short for leggings. This well made chemise is figure flattering and just the right length for me (5\\'2\"). i would wear it as a slip or a nightie. looking forward to wearing it! I was so excited to try these, it\\'s hard to find cute bermuda shorts. the legs were so wide. my husband asked if i was wearing his shorts. they don\\'t look that wide in the picture. i am 5\\'4\" and 130 lbs i bought my regular size 28 but the waist was huge i could have sized down one or two sizes. unrolled they came to my knee. I thought this was adorable on the model, but not so much on me. i actually didn\\'t mind it when i tried it on with a long cardigan, but i didn\\'t want to keep it for 1 look. the material felt inexpensive. the shape was very unflattering for an average sized women like myself. i\\'m 5\\'8\" and about 160 lbs. For anyone who loves lace. it fits pretty true to size. the size m length hits just to the top of the knee. i\\' 5\\' 4\" tall. to lighten up the dress just a little so that it does not look as some have said \"frumpy\" i hemmed the liner so that the liner hem is half way up on the ruffle. this makes the dress look less heavy, more fun, and repeats the openness of the lace on top. love this dress! will be wore a lot for summer evenings out. I absolutely loved this dress and when i received it, it was exactly the way it looked/fit online. the material is so pretty and the fit was amazing. it was a bit wrinkled, but i\\'m used to ironing things, so that didn\\'t bother me. unfortunately, i had to return it though because of the color. i\\'m filipino, and this yellow just isn\\'t flattering on someone with dark/tan skin. yellow is a tricky color for me to begin with, but this was more of a mustard yellow and just totally wrong for my coloring Saw this at the store and it is breathtaking in person. as the previous reviewer stated, i too consider this a dress and not a tunic, and it\\'s not really crinkled either. the dress is structured, very soft, and so gorgeous on. i tried on a regular x-small and it fit but a bit uncomfortable at the mid section. the small fit better (it\\'s meant to be a bit loose, bohemian looking) and the hem falls right at my knees which is perfect for the office (i\\'m 5\\'2\", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). i have medium o Darling jacket/coat, similar styling as the beige with big flowers and lace-up back that i bought a few years ago and still love. i was considering this one, but the description says to hand wash. seriously? a coat? that\\'s simply not practical. not sure if i will buy this one. This has instantaneously become my favorite sweater in my closet. the fit is great- a little oversized which makes it very cozy. i purchased my usual size xs. the shade of red is perfection. i wished it was a tad bit softer but would buy again and again! This model looks like a bauble head. she is absolutely too thin and sends the wrong message out to retailer shoppers. this last catalog\\'s models are anorexic and unhealthy looking.\\r\\n\\r\\ni ordered this shirt hoping it would fit, but it\\'s too small for 34dd. i am tall athletic and have breasts. \\r\\ni think of my shape as average - and the top didn\\'t fit. it\\'s cut narrow and small. I really like this dress/shirt. it\\'s great for layering, super cute and will hide my traditional holiday and this year\\'s pregnancy weight gain. i think it will be so cute with some leggings and boots.\\n\\nunfortunately the back panel of the dress does not seem to vary based on the size. this may sound weird but i\\'ve tried on an 8 and a 10 and the ability to reach forward didn\\'t change between the two sizes. i just returned the 10 and am hopeful the 12 i ordered will be slightly roomier in the back. This caught my eye, purely by accident as i was in the dressing room. immediately attracted to the pattern, the color, the quality and the shape of the skirt. lo and behold, it turned out to be maeve, one of my favorite designers at retailer. this skirt does not disappoint at all. i normally try to wait for sales to make a purchase, but this is well worth the full retail price. the skirt is very well made. the material is structured but not stiff. i also don\\'t normally like high waisted ski This is such a beautiful dress.  but have to return for the reasons others have noted.  the chest does not fit well. This sweater is beautiful, but is definitely more for looks than warmth. it\\'s very soft, but very thin. i prefer the way it looks open rather than buttoned. i got the moss green color on sale, and i am glad i didn\\'t pay full price for it--it\\'s lovely, but certainly not worth $88. I like this dress because it\\'s the perfect shape on me and i think the design is modern and cute. i got the red and i really like the pattern and the subtle tulle edging. the material is a little stretchy and substantial and there\\'s also a lining. i wore it with little booties like the model and tights and a cropped moto jacket and loved the outfit. i am short, small chest, but somewhat broad shouldered, the empire waist would not work on larger chested women with hourglass figures. I\\'m undecided about this shirt. this design is absolutely beautiful. but the shirt is very very sheer and the front comes down so low in a curved hem line. so, when you wear the necessary base layer, the shirt extends several inches beyond that and it looks kind of odd. i really wish tiny would make some beautiful shirts like this that aren\\'t sheer and have a shorter front. i purchased my regular size and it fits a little smaller than other tiny shirts i have purchased. since the shirt is so bea This dress is adorable. i found it to be true to size, but i do have a small bust so perhaps that helped with the sizing issue the other reviewer encountered. i love the embroidery throughout, it beautifully constructed and feels lush. i\\'m 5\\'9\" and the dress falls to my ankles, but that\\'s ok because it will look beautiful with heels or flats. i love the dress and cant wait to wear but gave it a 4-star rating because of the side zipper. it is extremely hard to zip up past your waist because of th First of all, i am only 5\\'1\", so this adorable tunic does fit me like a dress. i am also pear shaped, and this dress is flattering to my shape. but my biggest issue, it that the dress came in very wrinkled, especially the ruffles.\\ni took the dress to my retailer store, and they were able to steam some of the wrinkles out, but not all of them. it seems that the fabric used for the ruffles is suppose to be a little crinkly. but it will most likely look worse after you sit. therefore, i am uncertain I would have l loved to keep it but even the 0p was big. i have pretty broad muscular shoulders and back and i was swimming it. i wish retailer would stock more petites. i would repurchase if the 00p was available.  they always sell out very very quickly and they never restock. I like this top. another reviewer mentioned that it was a great top for a busty girl...i agree. i\\'m a 32g and could have sized down to a small, but i kept the medium because i wanted the extra length to have the option of wearing it as a dress. the small may have caused slight button pulling, but since the fabric has stretch and the top has a generous cut, it wouldn?t look insane. my only issue is the fabric pills. i wore the top once, and the fabric near the armpit pilled a lot, especially for This was an unexpected surprise. i love the material of this short sleeved (almost sweatshirt) summer tee. the entire design reads late summer stripes with a cozy twist! the first time i wore it made me realize how tricky it can be to wear stripes and this design deconstructs all my previous hangups! I finally ordered this after looking at it many times, had to order the 00p as they were out of all other petite sizes, and to my surprise, it totally fits me! why i put larger. both colors are equally nice, but due to my pale skin (and only petite available) i ordered the \"yellow\" one (brighter colors). cut is flattering, love the pleat detail in the skirt, the 00p fit my 30dd chest, and 26.5 inch waist. the length is perfect, above the knee in front and lower in the back. good choice... This top is fantastic. something about it has an ease of elegance and grace. the overall structure and design is aesthetically pleasing and easy to wear. i feel immediately put together and ready for anything. the fabric has great texture and flows well without feeling like the wind will carry you away. i purchased the off-white - it is a bit see-through, but i don\\'t mind wearing a cami underneath. I almost ordered this online to wear to a party later this week, but i\\'m glad i waited to try it on at the store (i wasn\\'t sure if i\\'d like the length of the petite or regular better.) i was so disappointed and didn\\'t end up getting either! i have two bailey 44 dresses from several years ago that are much more flattering and incredibly soft/comfortable. this fabric on this dress was much rougher and it really bothered me that the stripes cut off at the side seams and then don\\'t match up from the Runs small in the chest, so don\\'t order if you are large chested! over all, very cute. This jacket is a perfect, lightweight cover for dresses as shown online, but will also look great with jeans and tops. the embroidery looks amazing and is high quality. the tie in the back can make the shirt a little more form-fitted. while its a masculine style, its has feminine details and fit. this is my third hei hei jacket, the sizes between them are consistent (i\\'m 5\\'4\\'\\', 125lbs. 34c and i wear an xs in this jacket) - each one i\\'ve worn a million times! I know we\\'ve gotten to the point that polyester can be acceptable, but sometimes it\\'s still that horrible texture, unbreathable mess. unfortunately, that\\'s what this top is made out of. so it runs big, its billowy, and cute, but i couldn\\'t get it off quick enough because of the feel of the fabric. I hoped to love this based on the prior review, but i didn\\'t. it\\'s a beautifully crafted top but the print didn\\'t look good on me. and although i grabbed during the sale it\\'s too expensive to keep when it\\'s not perfect. I wanted this skirt to work! it is soft, comfortable, and cute! unfortunately, it runs to short.  i am 5\\'8\" and would not be able to pull it off at work. i ordered a bigger size and it still didn\\'t work. The neck is so big on this sweater, i couldn\\'t make it lay right. the shape of the sweater is odd. it is really wide on the upper torso, but tapers near your waist. it did not look as depicted on the model. the sweater is a lovely color, i liked the two-tone, but overall the fit was too weird for me. material is soft and it felt really nice on, but just too oddly shaped and a crazy big neck. I love the way this loosley falls and is so light you barely feel it on you. it is very sheer to you need to wear another tank underneath. It was quite a bit shorter on me than what it shows on the model who is the same height. the pull-on styling is a #fail as i could barely get my head through the neck opening! i was afraid it might rip a seam. the fabric seems low quality, like it would stretch out and degrade faster than others. overall, not the dress or quality i expected :/ Even at a very deep discount, this piece is definitely not worth the money. the picture made me think this jacket had a longer curved velvet hem as part of its design (which would be cool)--which is largely what attracted me to it, but as i discovered when it arrived, that was actually part of the shirt worn beneath in the photo. so this image is rather misleading. the actual jacket is very thin--more like a shirt with an open front than a jacket. the pockets are just loosely tacked inside. for Cute in the on line photo but in person it looks cheap and has gold running through it. if you look really close in the photo you can see it. When i saw this blouse online i thought it looked like a great combination of casual with the elegance of an intricate print. i was so disappointed when it came. the print is not centered in the front or the back. it looks like they were trying to save on the material and just cut it out wherever with no thought to symmetry. for this price the detail of centering the design was expected, especially because this is how it appeared in the picture. loved the blouse, but i will be returning it becau I was really excited to get this top in the mail; unlike other reviewers, i didn\\'t find that the top fit small, but i thought that the tight fit across the shoulders and chest didn\\'t look good with the billow-y torso of the top. i think this top would be flattering on really thin girls, but i\\'m very tall and broad shouldered, so it didn\\'t look as good on me. Ugh, i hate that this didn\\'t work! the top shoulder/sleeve portion is so pretty and unique, but the fabric is overall this and cheap feeling, the length is too short for how flowy the shirt is (the sides go way up on me). the fabric feels like something that would fall apart after one wash. back it goes! This sweater is so unique. not for the faint of heart but it\\'s beautiful. hubby thought pattern looked southeast asian inspired. the colors are saturated, vibrant. love the raglan sleeves and the tweed on the sleeves and in the back. the front material is slightly stiffer. i feel like i have a little bit more bulk in the stomach area than i want but i\\'m willing to overlook it. will be a great sweater for the holiday season. wear it with a skirt, jeans, skinny cargos. endless possibilities. I love this shirt. i actually bought two in black (my \"uniform\"), then decided to order one in white as well. however, the white shirt fit differently than the two black ones! it was significantly shorter; over 2\\' shorter! while the black tee is the perfect length, the shorter white version wasn\\'t flattering on me and kind of flared out around my waist...not the best look. that being said, i know the black shirt will be in heavy rotation for a while, and the people at retailer were very und When i ordered this online, i should have paid more attention to the picture. the dress comes to the knees of the 5\\'10\" model. i was swimming in small petite size. i checked the label and wondered whether i received the wrong size. nope, it was ps. either the dress was mislabeled, or this is cut huge. returning. too bad because the shape and color are cute. Such a great dress. fit is flattering. the small v cut in the front and beading around the neckline keep it from becoming a boring lbd. classy enough to wear to a funeral but can be dressed up with some killer shoes. thrilled with purchase! This is a beautiful dress but unfortunately it is only for women who are not well endowed - it is extremely well fitted in the chest. the high waste also poufs out due to a lot of extra material and the double lining. a beautiful dress but a very very poor construction. also there are bright blue and yellow beads in the chest area that are a bizarre combo to the corals and browns of the fabric. i am normally a 4/6 at retailer and the 8 was extremely small. This sweater was pretty short. beyond that, when i raised my arms, the thickness of the sweater caused the shoulders to rise up and stay there when i put my arms down. I thought this dress would be a cute beach cover up so i was excited to order it but i was very disappointed. i am 5\\'7 and i usually wear a size small top and 4 dress so i ordered a small in this dress but it was huge!! i understand that it is not meant to be form fitting and i wasn\\'t expecting it to be but when i tried this on i felt like i was wearing a potato sack. i feel like an extra small would have been just as bad. i was so upset. it also has thin silver lines through it which, for me, m Bought this in the store and fell in love with it. very soft and flattering to wear. however, after wearing it one day it is already starting to pill. this truly is a beautiful sweater, but i fear it will not be beautiful for long. i am willing to take the chance as i got it on sale. I was so excited to get these. i paid for two day shipping and ordered medium and large . sadly they did not fit. i usually wear medium but ordered both just in case. i\\'m very disappointed that they run so small and are not true to size. they are super cute from someone skinny. Very cute coat but could not keep it for the price...just not sure it is worth almost $200,00 (with tax added to cost). when it goes on sale, i will most likely buy it. Dress is very pretty, but very short, almost tunic length. I wanted a casual but special summer dress and had high hopes for this one. i normally like to try things on as it is difficult to tell fit online. when it arrived i was disappointed with this dress. it is very full in the skirt, the top fit a bit odd, not a lot of shape and not especially flattering. the fabric wasn\\'t very exciting either.  unfortunately this one went back. I always look for things to hide \"parts\" without making my \"parts\" look even more pronounced. this top is much cuter in person than online. it has floral edging around the neck and lace up area i didn\\'t notice. the length is perfect, the sleeve length is perfect and it makes me feel thin (even though it has stripes!). perfect spring summer top. I saw this on a mannequin in the store and so wanted it to work but was just too oversized and bulky. very good quality and material. I love the way the neckline is open not too low ! it also falls on your hips just right.\\r\\n\\r\\ngreat buy Did not work for me. whatsoever. the stripes were adorable but the piece just didn\\'t fit like on the model. the collar was practically choking me and the tie just didn\\'t make my figure look the way it normally does. aka i looked frumpy and chunky, which i\\'m not. going back. This is a beautiful dress, but the fit was strange. i have a small waist and larger hips. i generally wear a 0-2 in a fit & flare style, but styles like this i generally wear a 2-4 for my hips. even in a 4 this was catching on my hips and looked kind of dumpy on my top half.\\n\\ni really think this dress would be great on a frame that had wider shoulders and smaller hips. it really is pretty. I know we\\'ve gotten to the point that polyester can be acceptable, but sometimes it\\'s still that horrible texture, unbreathable mess. unfortunately, that\\'s what this top is made out of. so it runs big, its billowy, and cute, but i couldn\\'t get it off quick enough because of the feel of the fabric. Pretty fabric, nice style, took it back. I\\'m 5\\'8\" small 115 pounds. ordered the xs. this dress is gorgeous! my husband loved it! i tried several sticky bras... nothing worked. i\\'m 32dd \\r\\ni gave up. if your ok with no support, you\\'ll love this dress. sexy back, perfect length, so light! I wear med or large in most items. the medium was huge. fit like a moo moo. size down by at least two. This skirt is great and you can\\'t beat it for the price. it fits more like a pencil skirt on me, and looks sort of a-line on the model. very nice work appropriate skirt. though the slit comes higher than i expected. my thighs are tattooed so i put on some black tights and it looks great with a blouse and cardigan! I ordered these in my usual pilcro petite size 6. they were impossible to button, which is interesting \\'cause i also ordered the pilcro wide leg chinos in the same size and they fit perfectly, as usual. but it ended up being ok because i don\\'t care for the speckled, slightly rough material or the contrasting piping. back they go! This top fits like shown in the pictures. however, i bought the rose color and thought it was a little \"off\". would have loved to find the ivory in my size. I was expecting a tee shirt, but the material is more of light sweater knit. in the end it wasn\\'t the fabric that was the deal breaker...it was the fit. in my regular size it is too wide and boxy through the body. i also felt like the arms are too big as well. it\\'s going back and i am not going to bother ordering it in a smaller size. it\\'s a shame because the embroidery really is lovely. I love this t-shirt! it is so soft, fits true to size and great with jeans or shorts. i purchased in yellow and plan to purchase other colors! Bummed out.. this is super cheaply made and very expensive... the design is different , the color is beautiful, but the material is a different story.. it should be priced at the most 30 bucks.. not 128.. i\\'m returning them. also, they run very big..! I love the pants and it\\'s so soft and they\\'re great. today was the first day i wore them for more than just a try on and i noticed a hole. that\\'s super disappointing but i\\'m hoping it was just bad luck ;( Great fit and quality. i\\'m 5\\'3\" and 130 lbs, size 4 fit perfectly. bought both the blue and black. could definitely dress up or down! I love baseball style tees and when i saw the homebase tee (in two colors no less), i was very thrilled especially since it was during the 20% mother\\'s day promotion on all items. based on the model\\'s photos, the top looks flattering with a swing type style. i usually wear a medium and bought a small size in this top. when the package was delivered, i excitedly opened it and found two tees looking like maternity tops which would be lovely if i was pregnant. the tops are so wide not like the webs This is a cute top, but not worth the price in my opinion. i love the colors, pattern and soft material used. however, the fabric is quite thin and just not worth paying $58. The material is super soft and i could see how this could be a great fall sweater, but the furry portion made the top too bulky. i should\\'ve sized down, but even then i think it still would\\'ve been a touch boxy. if it was boxy all the way through it\\'d be fine, but it feels like just the top was bulky while the bottom half was fine. perhaps good for more broad shouldered people. i have very small shoulders. also reminded me too much of a sheepskin rug. Fun versatile top for casual wear with capris, denim, or shorts/skirts. purchased both striped versions. love ballet necklines. the 3/4 length sleeve is wonderful for spring, summer, fall in california. the top is fitted yet it runs small. be sure to sized up. i normally wear xs, however this was way too tight. so i\\'ve ordered a small in both. hoping it works perfectly. The quality of the shirt is top notch. the fabric is lightweight and comfortable.\\r\\nnow the cons:\\r\\nthis top is cut like a square and fits wide which is not apparent in the photo. definitely not for me. I loved the print on this top in navy from the picture, and loved it even more in person. it is gorgeous, and the top feels high quality. that said, as usual with maeve clothing it fit me strangely. i am curvy with a small upper body (34 d) but larger bust, and maeve tops are almost always too tight in the bust and too flowy around the middle , which creates a pregnant look on me at least. i feel their fit model must be small busted, so for small busted ladies this top would be lovely. i always So, this is just the most lovely romper. beautifully made, flowey. very comfortable, until you have to take it off.\\r\\nthis is the review i posted on facebook. \\r\\nso, no man i know has ever ever ever experienced the abject terror, or maybe has not shared with me, that moment when you cannot get out of, because it has turned into a straight jacket, that otherwise cute romper. and again, maybe a man invented it! I like the light fabric and embroidery on a otherwise hard look (bomber). feminine can be worn casually with jeans and a t-shirt, or over a dress. lovely on every note. fit: i ordered botih the xxs p and xsp. (had tried on regular xs in store) tried on the xxsp first and kept it (didn\\'t try on xs p). since the fit is loose (bomber) on me i like it a little more fitted. there is enough room for a sweater. \\r\\n\\r\\ni am 115 lbs, 30 dd, 26.5 in waist. arms were not too snug either... This top looked super cute online but when it came it was super short and boxy. looked like a tent on me. this one went back the same day it came! This shirt looks nice on the model, but it felt stiff and unflattering on me. i am 5\\'5\", 135lbs, 34c, and the size 4 fit overall. i just didn\\'t happen to like it on me. This shirt has absolutely no shape. look carefully at the model and you we discover she is cleverly positioned to hide the sheer boxy-ness of this shirt. the print is beautiful but it looks like a maternity shirt. i even ordered the xs at 5\\'7 and 130 lbs but found it too baggy. returned. I was attracted to the feminine design of the dress, the silhouette, the flouncy skirt; however, i ordered the red motif pattern and hated the splotchy, dark colors. I bought this top online in the stripes/ivory lace. fits great and is beautiful quality. (i usually wear small/size 4 in tops and the small was perfect). however, i found that the ivory lace detail on the bottom sides gave me a saddlebag effect. not good. sadly it\\'s going back. I bought a size small (5\\'6\" & 130lbs). it was baggy everywhere so i added a belt similar to the model and it did help some but the pockets stuck out too much. i ended up looking \"hippy\" with no butt. the material is nice and it is a nice quality. i just didn\\'t have enough to fill it out anywhere and i felt if i got a xs it would have been too short in the crotch area. I loved this top when i saw it online. i was able to go in the store and try it on and sadly, it is not the top for me. if you have a large chest, then this top will gather at your cleavage and give an awful appearance. the fabric falls in and even the sales associate agreed that it was unsightly. if i were an a or b, this probably would have worked. i should have known to stay away from a pleated top. So this may be my least favorite thing i have ever bought from retailer. this top had so much extra material it was like wearing a bag or parachute. it looked a million times cuter in the photos. This looks so gorgeous on the model on the site, so i ordered it online. it was incredibly frumpy when i tried it on. looks like i took a floor rug, cut a hole in the middle and slipped it over my head. the sweater itself is so pretty, its just too bad it falls so awkwardly on me. i normally wear a small so i ordered the xs/s and the sleeves still fall past my thumbs. its kind of itchy too. will be returning this asap. Waist is tight and thighs and legs are not. -not flattering- ankle opening is too small, and they have a funny smell. I took advantage of the summer tag sale and bought a few tops including this one. i\\'ve been eyeing this online for quite some time, so i was pretty excited to get it at such a good price. it came in the mail the other day. it\\'s like christmas morning when you see an retailer package at your door, however, this time wasn\\'t so great. the top is fine. average at best. the top fits true to size. maybe it\\'s the pattern or the cut, but it didn\\'t work well on my body. i recommend trying this on first. I was so excited to try this on in the store, because i\\'ve had my eye on it online. unfortunately, it is not like the picture. the material is very thin, almost translucent. i also could not figure out how it get it on! the cape has short sleeves, not long, as it appears in the picture, and the folds of fabric would not drape quite right in the front. love the look of black design on white. hopefully retailer can redo this in a thicker cape for the fall, but for now, i\\'ll skip this one. I ordered the blue dress because i loved the color and unique design. the blue was much more of a dark navy, not a sapphire blue as it looks in the picture. the picture also shows it tying on the side. it did not tie on the side when i tried it on but in the front as pictured in the red version of the dress. it was not at all flattering on me. one of the few disappointing things i have ordered from retailer. This skirt runs very large--even in the petite line. there was also no shape to the skirt (at least as it looked on my body). the color was nice (in the pink-grapeish hue), but ultimately the skirt just looked like a tent on my body (00p). I wouldn\\'t be so unhappy if these pants cost about 75% less. they are so cheaply constructed. one wash and they\\'re all but guaranteed to shrink. the material is so cheap and flimsy not at all what i expect from retailer. they are also 32 inch inseam not 35.5 as stated on the web site which is the whole reason i bought them. My 16 year-old daughter fell in love with this when we saw it in the store at the beginning of the summer, but it was much, much too expensive. when i saw it on sale at the end of the summer, i jumped on it. she loves it. I so wanted to love this suit! it is so unique and cute, however it does not wear well on a short girl! i am 5\"4 and the torso was much too short for me so the cut down the middle looked really wide and odd and the suit just made me look stumpy instead of sexy. also, for how expensive this suit it i also thought the material was pretty thin for how expensive this suit is. i\\'m sad to say it is going back. Very nice casual corduroy skirt for the fall. it sits nicely at the waist and the asymmetrical cut gives it some visual interest. it has a slightly a-line shape and the side seams round up a couple of inches. i took a point off for it not being lined, and the closure relies on the zipper alone instead of having a hook along with the zipper. i took my usual small and like how it fits. my only concern is that it is a little on the short side for me but since it\\'s a fall skirt and will always be wo I debated between the xs and the small..and ended up with the small because it\\'s 100% cotton i probably couldn\\'t probably gotten the xs one. we will see if it shrinks. i hope it does a little. i do wish the retailer sizing was a little more consistent because sometimes the xs is fine. I absolutely adore this top. the design on the front is super bright and beautifully done, so beware if you do not like bright colored patterns. i normally wear a size medium and bought a large in this shirt because of reading other reviews, i am glad i did so. i have broad shoulders and muscular arms, and i believe a medium would not have fit my arms and shoulders. however, it is a little boxy in the torso area because of the extra material. therefore, i feel a large feels like a medium in the I love this dress. i\\'ve received compliments from everyone. it\\'s long enough to feel appropriate for work or teaching in sunday school - and, it\\'s beautiful! I don\\'t know how to explain, but this dress at least for me did not look like the model, first off the dress is extremely heavy and extremely long and then where the fur starts, for me it didn\\'t start at the right spot so it was very awkward looking... so definitely not for my type of body, i am normal height (5\\'5\\'\\', athletic and curvy body) but maybe for a very tall person looks good! the material is very interesting, it\\'s so soft! Ordered on line and thought these are a great quality as i pulled them out of the box. tried them on and found minimal elastic for the waist. within minutes of wearing, the waist fell down past my hips...glad i was at home. looks cute but will not stay up. Weird fit and the tie just add to the problems. i think i\\'d like this a lot more if it were just an open cardigan without the tie. the tie seems like an after thought. it\\'s flimsy and it just makes anyone wearing this look like a house -- no matter there size. i ordered a medium black and it\\'s already in the mail! I really wanted to love this dress, but it was so short! i\\'m only 5\\'6\" so i don\\'t consider myself really tall, but the dress only came a couple of inches lower than my butt! way too short for me. my husband asked if it was a shirt or dress haha. but i think this would look adorable on someone a few inches shorter. or someone younger who can pull of a short shirt :) I saw that there was metallic detail when i ordered it, but i wasn\\'t prepared for the entire thing to be metallic. it fit tts, but wasn\\'t what i was looking for. This top looks just like you see it on the website - design is super cool and color is awesome, almost acid washed in areas. but know that this top is super, super thin and will not provide any warmth. i wish it were a bit thicker in fabric, it would have been perfect for the cool fall and going into winter especially for the price. the medium in this one fit me better than the small. i am 5\\'9 and 140 lbs. I purchased this top in a size s. it is lovely but way too wide. i am 5\\'8\" and 140 lbs. so it\\'s unusual for me to have to size down to an xs. i am going to see if sizing down helps, but i am worried it will still be too wide. the fabric seemed of high quality and i loved the faded color so i am going to give it another chance. I really likes these jeans. they are comfortable with stretch and look cute. the price is high but an investment for sure ! Really love this jacket! i agree with the previous review that while the x small fits great when i am standing--it is a little hard to raise my arms in it. however- it is great to wear over a dress or with jeans at the office. great quality- lined with jersey. i\\'ve gotten many compliments! (5\\'8, 120 lbs, xsmall) I love this designer so i grabbed at this shirt immediately. unlike their other items, this shirt is linen. it\\'s a great cut and very flattering once you iron it. the only problem i found was that as i wore it throughout the day, she shirt became wrinkled and misshapen to the point where it ballooned out around my stomach. I received this jumpsuit today in size medium. i am normally a size 4-6. overall, the jumpsuit fit. i am 5\\' 8.5\" tall and the length was fine if i wore flats. the issue with this jumpsuit is the bottom half. the top jersey wrap part fit great--nice and stretchy, fit nicely on the curves. the problem is that the wrap part stops at your rib cage and the pants begin somewhere way up high, definitely on the rib cage. the gathering of the pants gave me a pooch where i don\\'t have one, but the deal kil This coat is cool, the cut is classic and well fit. i\\'ve been wearing it as a jacket every day since purchasing 3 days ago. it already has begun to slightly pill. i have not worn this under other jackets, so it\\'s pilling quickly from very basic wear. I don\\'t know how to explain, but this dress at least for me did not look like the model, first off the dress is extremely heavy and extremely long and then where the fur starts, for me it didn\\'t start at the right spot so it was very awkward looking... so definitely not for my type of body, i am normal height (5\\'5\\'\\', athletic and curvy body) but maybe for a very tall person looks good! the material is very interesting, it\\'s so soft! Like one of the previous reviewers, when my jacket arrived, it was not in the great dark wash pictured online. it was in a basic, medium denim wash. i like the wash pictured online; i did not like the wash the jacket came in. additionally, know that it is just huge. i ordered my usual size (medium) and understood that the jacket was meant to be roomy and swingy, but there is no way that one size down would be enough to compensate for how swimmingly large it was. i never tried an xs, but it was s This is just a really fun jacket. agreed with the previous reviewer that it\\'s not the most functional. but guess what -- this is super cozy (it\\'s lined with the softest faux fur), it\\'s quilted in an army green, and it has the best trim along the arm. they could\\'ve cut corners on the quality here, for instance, with the beading or the material on the trim. however, they didn\\'t cut those corners. instead, the jacket feels incredibly well made and feels very expensive. can\\'t wait till the weather g Yikes. there is a whole lot of skirt here. i am 5\"4, weigh around 120 lb, and usually wear anywhere between a four and six in retailer clothing, depending on the designer. this skirt balloons out from the waist. on the website it seems to flow more naturally from the waist. i think that the flowers are cute but the material is cheap looking. the skirt is very long- hitting way below mid-calf. there is also tons of material - creating a parachute effect. definitely returning. The fabric of this top is a tee shirt, mid weight material. it has a nice drape and the color variations along the vee are true to the photo. i purchased size large and it\\'s a bit wide and long for my frame. you could safely size down. the fabric drapes nicely but i didn\\'t like the sleeves or length and it fits large so am returning. Billowy top - perfect for casual comfort. the topic is definitely not raspberry-- it is a sunset orange. disappointed as i was going for a match. i should have gone off of the picture and not the color name. These are long, easily wear with skinny jeans, they do not cling and are not see through! the colors are great! I really wanted to love this shirt. the snowflake and stripe design is really cute, and the fabric is of nice quality. it\\'s a very loose fit, which i would\\'ve been willing to work with, but... as mentioned in previous reviews, the shoulder seam rests in an odd place on your upper arm, and there are little bumps in the fabric on the arms that appear similar to what happens if you leave a shirt on a wire hanger too long. it looks like you have nubby little wings coming out of your arms. not attrac Fabric is soft, body runs a bit big but falls nicely. length is great for leggings or skinny jeans. overall, wonderful tee shirt! I ordered down a size based on other reviews. i am 5\\' tall, 110 lbs and a size 26 is a great fit. i ordered both the navy and turquoise colors. my only complaint is the turquoise color is not the vibrant blue in the photo but more of a green tone. These leggings are very comfortable and cute. only reason they are not 5 stars is because the pattern is not quite as vibrant as i was expecting. I have a similar pair of capris from retailer and when i ordered these i thought they were the same in a different color. these are less flattering and i may not keep them. Not my typical sleepwear, but glad that i took a chance, as it is super cozy for lounging. i was worried about covering my bottom (as i purchased the matching leggings), and ordered s based on prior reviews. ended up exchanging for xs as it was too oversized. could have purchased the petite probably as xs is still a bit long (5\\'2\"), though fits like in photos. The dress is too big. i got size 4, after checking the measurements chart (for reference: 5\\'7\", 125 lb). it is too wide, not as fitted as in the picture. the cut is too deep (might work better for a bustier lady, but looks pathetic on me). \\r\\n\\r\\nthe pattern is too bright, much brighter that in the picture (i got red pattern). it\\'s not that the photos represent the colors inaccurately, it\\'s just... the colors are much more vibrant in real life.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe material is heavier than i expected. I got this piece because it was so unique.. that\\'s one of the things i love so much about retailer: not afraid to go where no woman has gone before, so i ordered it in a 4p, my usual size, and a 4. i am petite, but the 4 worked perfectly, i think. i am pretty voluptuous below the waist and medium to small on the top and the 4p was too small all over - so i would agree that it runs small.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe quality is excellent, the look is great. my husband liked it on me. it might work for the office with so I fell in love with this dress online, but it just doesn\\'t look as nice in person. first of all, it\\'s huge. i usually take a 4-6 in dresses. i ordered a size 4 in this, and it was like a sack on me. i would have needed at least two sizes smaller. however, after seeing it in person, i didn\\'t love it enough to order a smaller size to get a better fit. This was going to be my go to top. i loved the look of the billowy shirt, especially in light blue. when it arrived, i knew it wouldn\\'t work for my body. i\\'m athletic build with muscular upper arms and a d cup. i tried it on anyway. i really wish it fit. it was snug in the upper arms and pulled a bit in the front. i knew if i ordered a size up the arms would still be tight. it\\'s just the cut of the shirt. this top is best for someone that isn\\'t busty and has slender upper arms. This dress makes you feel like a bohemian goddess.  falls in the right area and absolutely adorable.  the dress is very fragile, handle with care. As another reviewer wrote.. this is not the same jean featured on the website. same cut and style but it\\'s a light denim wash with wiskering and worn look at the knees. i called customer service to see if this was a mistake and they said there was not really a way to check it unless i exchanged them. i didnt want the same wrong jeans again so i opted out ... too bad they are cure. Runs shorter than i expected.  i purchased on line but will be returning it for a larger size. I wanted to love this dress, it looks beautiful on the model but it isn\\'t the flattering, even on sale i am not sure if it would be worth it, it it runs pretty big. I ordered this top because i liked the look in the back, however, the top i received looks nothing like the back. online it shows that the back has elastic & is gathered. also online it shows thin straps (that look like a bra strap) but my top has no thin straps & no elastic~ extremely odd!! i called customer service but the lady i spoke to didn\\'t have any information or complaints about the top. i\\'m holding on to the top because it is cute from the front, but i was really wanting the back to lo This is a cute dress but the fabric is very heavy and i didn\\'t find it to drape well on me. it is a very heavy felted poly type of fabric. i ordered it for a specific event coming up this summer and the fabric will not work for warm temps. the style and design of the dress is great though. for reference it did fit fairly true to size. i wear a 0 or 2. the xs fit well. if the fabric works for your situation then i would try this dress. Love this top. it\\'s everything all the previous viewers said....except that the white isn\\'t white but a creamy white.it has a yellow under tone.. this restricts my over all plans,but i still like it. I received this top and loved the pattern. however, i ordered both and s and m, and the bust sizing on this top is very odd. i am a 34c, and the bust area was way too big on both, but if i had sized down to the xs the rest of the suit would be too small. maybe it\\'s just made for busty people? also the supportive material in the bust area goes straight across kind of like a bandeau, so that added to the odd look of the bust. it\\'s still a beautiful pattern, so if you\\'re going to give it a try orde Oh how i love moth sweaters but wow was this one a disappointment. the color is wonderful, the shape is unique and the stitch work is lovely but that\\'s where the compliments end. it\\'s an itchy, cheap feeling acrylic that is too short for my torso. i am truly disappointed that at this price point it was such a cheap feeling piece. so bummed. so so bummed. I loved the fit and vibrant color of this dress. it\\'s loose and flows but doesn\\'t look like a potato sack. i wore it once and got a ton of compliments. that said, i hand washed it, as the tag states, then let it line dry, and it shrunk to half its size! i re-checked the tag and noticed that under the hand wash instructions it then states \"dry clean recommended.\" boo. so disappointed that i spend over $100 for a dress i wore once. Wasn\\'t expecting this to look good on when i grabbed it off the sale rack. to my surprise it\\'s very cute. the very high up slits for the 2 front panels and the lightweight knit break up the heavy appearance of this poncho when it\\'s on. you can slip your arms out of the sleeves to keep warm when the evening gets cooler. i love it. got the gray and black stripes on off white background. will try belting the two front panels, as another reviewer suggested. i\\'m 5\\'3\" petite. so, it doesn\\'t swallow me This sweater is ok. i love, love, love bell sleeves so i thought for sure this would be perfect. i thought it would be a great sweater to transition from winter to spring, but once it arrived, i knew i had to return. the sleeves are not only bell but very long and the sweater fits chunky on your midsection. i like my sweaters more flowy. if you like fitted-style sweaters that are a bit roomy you would like this once. also, it\\'s a bit itchy for me-but i\\'m rather sensitive and if i\\'d loved this on Beautifully made shirt however the sizing is way off. the sleeves and across the chest are really tight while the rest of the shirt fits fine. if you get a size larger then the shirt in the body is to large. would recommend if you have really tiny shoulders, arms and chest. such a shame since i really love the shirt. I ordered this top in white along with the meadow rue lace sleeve top. while they are the same price, they aren\\'t even close in quality. this top is one of the sheerest tops that i have seen. the trim, pocket and the lace-up tie are made from sheer type material that was twisted and didn\\'t lay right, and the tag sewn inside, was sewn with red thread and showed through, very visible. i don\\' t think it would hold up after many washes. i returned this one and ordered another color in the lace sleev This well made chemise is figure flattering and just the right length for me (5\\'2\"). i would wear it as a slip or a nightie. looking forward to wearing it! I ordered a small, which is my usual retailer size, but this was like a tent on me. it\\'s fine if you like things super super blousey but that wasn\\'t what i was looking for. also it is very long, a very weird amount of long. also there is only eyelet on the front. the whole back of the shirt is just plain fabric. i like the idea of this shirt but all in all it was very disappointing. Material is strange. triangle top is funky. this is just not awesome in any way. I agree with the review that says this is better in person than in the pic online. great sale price and super cozy but thin enough to transition to spring! This dress is perfection! great, quality fabric. bright vibrant color. the design and texture allow it to be dressed up or dressed down. i sized up a size because my normal wasn\\'t available and it fits perfectly! This is a beautiful dress. the quality is excellent. the 3 layers and the embroidery are beautiful... however it just didn\\'t look right on me. it looked like a maternity dress. i am very petite, short with a big bust and it just did nothing for me. i think this style would look best on a tall woman with a smaller bust. unfortunately i will be returning this dress. This reminded me of big bird in person and just adds volume to your body. i\\'m thin and usually wear a size 0, so i\\'m not sure who this may look good on. Bought this in cream in my usual xs/0, (5\\'7\", 32b, 115lbs). it is a very flattering summer weight cardi which will work well with jeans and maxi dresses this summer. i would point out however that the sleeves are very snug - if you don\\'t have thin arms then you may have to consider sizing up. i stuck with the xs even though i had to carefully pull the arms on because the s was just a little looser in the back. the sleeves are meant to be form fitting but i think they have been designed a little This dress has been in my inbox for a long time and when it went on sale i purchased it right away. i am a size 4 petite in everything retailer and have not had a problem with fit, if anything i might have to size down. i purchased a 4 petite in this dress and i couldn\\'t zip it all the way up. it was as if i was trying to get into a 0 petite.  i don\\'t even think a size 6 would fit. there is something not right with the make of this particular dress i received. even if the fit was perfect i didn\\'t I like this top a lot, very nice. i love the design, style, and fabric. but it runs too small. i have a curvy figure, and it pulls in the front so you can see between the buttons, and pulls at the bottom as well. i usually wear l or xl, in xl this one was still a bit fitted especially around the bust. i am still keeping it - hoping to lose a few pounds. but it is a very nice top with the fabric, design, and style. very stylish! it looks casual on the model but can be dressy. I saw this coat online and loved it. the blue collar is great. the length is great, fits over bottom. it is quite warm. the arms are a little tight but they loosen up. the sale price plus 40% off was the ticket. Order a whole size down and this may work. i\\'m normally a 6-8 or a medium but this was huge. ordered the small because i loved the color/design. hopeful! Super cute skirt. i decided to return it because i felt like i did\\'t have enough tops to go with it. This was an unexpected surprise. i love the material of this short sleeved (almost sweatshirt) summer tee. the entire design reads late summer stripes with a cozy twist! the first time i wore it made me realize how tricky it can be to wear stripes and this design deconstructs all my previous hangups! I didn\\'t really notice the collar when i ordered it on line and i\\'m not really liking it. it\\'s the rough, unstitched thing they like to do sometimes and it just makes it look slightly more casual and well, rough around the edges. it\\'s a nicely cut, great fitting sweater though so i\\'ll be looking for some scarves! Looks like a pregnancy top. a lot gathers in front and back. added 10 pounds to me. not flattering on, much longer than on the model. and the color is not white. it\\'s white with a weird tan/ taupe stripe.\\r\\ni returned it same day i received it, which was disappointing. Love the fabric & lace on this top. like other reviews said the arm area is tight where the lace meets the fabric which makes the fit uncomfortable. sadly this top is going back. if you have very skinny upper arms this top will fit fine. Wonderful, slimming leggings. snappy and a great accessory for any professional outfit. I am sure these pants are right for someone, just not me. i am wider in the hips, and they just were really unflatering. the fabric is very lightweight, which i wasn\\'t expecting, and so while the pleats are interesting, with my hips they ended up hitting in just the wrong place. the waist was also much lower than i expected -- not low rise, but i\\'m used to thinking high waist with wide legs. in short, these pants are probably great on some body types, just not mine. also very long. i\\'m 5-8 and a I bought this sweater online and was surprised by how thick and fluffy it is. this is a warm and cozy sweater, more bulky than oversized. pattern has a comic book-style art look. it has raglan sleeves and a boxy cut and narrows a bit at the waist. cute, warm sweater for winter--wore with an undershirt. Even on sale sale...this tank is not worth the money. the design in the back is adorable & would expect it to be so much better quality but the fabric is flimsy(think old man white tanks that come in a pack) completely see through and lack of shape..i wanted to love this but definitely photographed significantly better than actuality! Material is hard to wear a bra under it I love byron lars. very taken with his fabrics and design concepts and i have ordered several of his dresses but i believe i need to surrender to the fact that they do not work for my body type. the dress is gorgeous in person: all the fabrics are great, the dress is fully lined and lots of nice finishing touches. it is a unique and very striking dress; this one i really wanted. however, it is designed for a woman who is proportionally longer, leaner with a larger bust size than i have. i ordere This jacket was too wide and the length in the arms too short. i wear a medium in almost any article of clothing and felt like i was swimming in a short little jacket. the ratio of how wide it is to the length is not for me but might work well with other body types. the arms were definitely too short. Do not buy! i used my 15% discount on this. what a waste. my usual sizes range from s to l depending on what brand. i should have gotten a small. i don\\'t think that would\\'ve helped. it was so awkward looking. nothing like the model. it made me look as if i had gained 15 pounds. it was waaay longer in the back-like a mullet. the material was really thick. it is more appropriate for fall. i had high hopes for this-to dress up or down. it was just so ridiculous. I want to the store to try this skirt on. that had only one size m in stock (my size) and it was huge! i ordered an xs and it fits nicely. it\\'s just what i needed for the warm days ahead. Really wanted to love this, especially with the lacing and long length for this off-the-shoulder top. when the top arrived, the lacing was stiff and length of the straps were long so that the bottom of the lace didn\\'t completely cover my black strapless bra (and i felt it sat a bit too low down my chest). thought about taking in the straps but then the area around the armpits would be uncomfortable. i did love the length of the top though. wish this top was a keeper, but going to have to return. This jacket is just as stunning in person as online. high quality and just overall fabulous design. as much as i loved it though i couldn\\'t get over the fact i was jingling every time i moved. it seemed like it could cause piling issues and i thought it might get annoying wearing for an entire day. i loved this and wanted so hard to keep it but i need functional chic pieces not noise makers. anyways fit was great looked just like the model on me so i would recommend but with caution as for this I bought this top in the store and love it. i was surprised to see negative reviews online. i am small chested, curvier on the bottom. this top does have a wide and short fit but the cut is flattering. all three colors are beautiful. i wear it with high waist short jean shorts and it looks very fresh. A cute top. the peplum seam hits me at the right spot on my waist. for my curvy figure, this isn\\'t always the case. i also am drawn to tanks that i can actually wear a bra underneath without showing bra straps.\\r\\ni usually vary between a medium and a large in deletta, but definitely needed a large.\\r\\ni ordered the \"lavender\" color, which is disappointing; a dull gray. i\\'ve decided to return and order the coral instead. The peplum for this time hit me in the middle of my rib cage, not at my natural waist, so it looked very odd when it flared out with the peplum so high up. i am busty so it\\'s possible this would not be the case for everyone but i generally can wear peplum tops with no problem. i was disappointed to return it, the fabric was very nice and the concept behind the shirt was a good one. Liked everything about this coat but the length! it is beautiful and good quality. first, ordered a medium because the fit seemed slight (i\\'m a 4-6), returned it for a large. unfortunately, the large will also be returned -- the body length is very cropped, not at all as it appears in photo to meet the top of a waistband. i\\'ll hope to find a similar coat with just a bit more length. I wanted to love this dress. i saw it in the catalog in blue, and wanted it. however, for some reason i took my sweet time in ordering it, and by the time i did, only the orange was available: but on sale. i was so excited when it arrived, and as i was trying it on, i thought, this is a bit shorter in the skirt than i usually go but it\\'s so pretty... and then i couldn\\'t get my right arm in the sleeve at all. i wondered if i had caught some of the lining as i was putting it on or something, but n I received this dress today for a june wedding. i was so excited about it and the quality is beautiful but unfortunately i am going to have to return it. it runs very big. i normally like to wear items a bit bigger/baggier but with this dress it needs to be tight on the sides. bummer :( I loved these pants - super soft and cozy and perfect for winter. i\\'ve worn them a handful of times and have washed them maybe twice max and they already have 2 holes! they don\\'t say handwash and my washer/dryer is brand new and pretty gentle on my clothes. maybe i just ended up with a bad pair, but i found the quality to be disappointing :( I have been looking for an off-white vest and thought this one would be perfect, except it is going back. i am 5\\'9\" 150 lbs. medium is my normal top size, but this medium was tight even though the design looks relaxed in the picture. no buttons, so no way to close it. unlined and the design and fabric look more casual than the photo. not worth the price. I wanted to love this dress so much and am so sad - it just didn\\'t work for me. i am 5\\'2\", 138 pounds (still trying to lose that last 5-8 from my third daughter) and the chest/back of this dress was so tight i was afraid if i hugged someone it would split up the back. i am normally a size 6 and tried the 6 p, 8 p and 8 and they were all too tight in the chest/back. it sounds like this is common for these holding horses dresses. :( Adorable romper. the only thing is the sleeves are a little shorter than portrayed in the picture. they come to about mid-forearm on me (and i\\'m a petite person). still cute but def not if you\\'re looking for a full sleeve. Pilcro stet roll ups are my fave! i have about 5 or 6 pairs and i needed a replacement for my light wash so i went in the store and tried these on. wow has the quality changed. the denim is a lot lighter in material, now, the wash isn\\'t as real, almost like i\\'m wearing jegging shorts. these were my favorite but now i\\'ll have to look for light wash denim shorts elsewhere because these new ones just wont cut it anymore! why, pilcro?? the sizing is about the same, they run a little large due to the Really love the print of this dress and the eyelet detailing around the neck! very flattering! This is a fantastic dress for fall, if you have specific proportions. the dress comes in s-m-l, rather than in particular dress sizes, so my assumption was that a large would fit a range of 10-12. the dress fits me well in the fitted waist (which has zero give), but the top fits very strangely (you can even detect it on the model in the photo), with a tightness at the clavicle, and a weird abundance of fabric above the waistband.\\r\\n\\r\\ni will still happily wear the dress with sweaters this season, It\\'s rare for a dress to completely not work on me, but this dress completely did not work on me. i\\'m tall and have an hourglass figure. i got this dress in my usual size s. this dress somehow made me look ridiculously pear shaped. the empire type bust of the dress made both my bust (32c) and my waist look pretty much non-existent. it looked so bad on me i actually laughed. it\\'s a shame though, because i had been eyeing this dress for a long time. and it is a beautiful dress, but i would not rec This top is one of my favorites, i can\\'t get over how much i love the design. the dots are adorable and i received a ton of compliments. the back of the top quite a bit longer, and it looks great. my only complaint is that it runs a bit small on the top. even though the shirt is perfectly sized on me, i bent over to slip on my shoe and one of the buttons popped off after less than a minute of wearing it. I am between a xs and s but figured i would order down based on the reviews. well, it\\'s still huge. i have about 5 inches that i can take in from the side. i have ordered the xxs and am hoping it will look more flattering. i love the colors and design, but as it is it does not do anything for me. for reference i am 124 lbs, 32d, 5\\'5\". Tried on a size 2 regular and it fit well, felt incredibly soft and airy, and is handwashable. i\\'m 5\\'2\", currently 33-25-37 or 38, with narrow shoulders and torso, somewhat long-waisted but petite from bust to shoulders. i often wear a size 0p or 0 in retailer dresses and tops. the arm holes were a tiny bit low, but not terrible. a petite would have been shorter, but also more of an empire waist. the pink really is more of a red like the online photo; great color. I tried this blouse on and loved the style, comfort and color of the peach so much that i was preparing to buy it. when i pulled the sleeve the fabric came away from the cuff. i tested another spot pulling only gently and the same thing happened. too bad since the color would have been a great addition for me. \\r\\n\\r\\nbut--i also tried the blue and it gets 4 stars, as the fabric is much better. it too is adorable, soft and did not tear on gentle testing. the two blouse colors are made from different Runs very large. ordered a smaller size due to other reviews but should have ordered several sizes smaller This top is very cute! however, it runs quite large. i ordered my usual size - xs but it looked rather heavy on me. the construction of the top was boxy and didn\\'t produce the same feminine look as it does on the modeled picture. it\\'s a very cute design but i would order a size down for a better fit. I purchased this top on sale and it\\'s almost perfect. the pleats under the rib cage make the bottom bell out a little bit - not enough to make me want to return it, but i\\'m glad i didn\\'t pay full price! Super soft comfy underwear. i sized up and they fit perfectly. normally wear xs and bought m for most comfortable fit. they don\\'t ride up. i ended up ordering 5 more pairs. super comfy without being too \"mom\" like. I have been searching for grey jeans and haven?t found anything that i truly love. i tried on both a 25p and 26p. the 25p was too tight and i don?t think they would have stretched out enough for me to be comfortable in. the 26p was close but i was afraid they would stretch out too much. they looked good from the front but did nothing for my cushion. the color, length and feel of the jeans was perfect. in the end they went back and the hunt continues for grey jeans. i would recommend trying these I wear a 25/26 jean and the size s in this bikini bottom was just too small. in photos it looks so cute, but on me it just didn\\'t look like anything special. hopefully the larger size has more pizzazz. The dress is extremely high quality! i purchased the dress in black. the white collared shirt that the model is wearing under the dress is not part of the dress. the dress overall is like a balloon. unless you\\'re extremely tall and skinny this dress makes you look bigger! i ordered the small petite and am 125 lbs and 5\\'4. i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it\\'s going back:( the petite hits 3 inches above the knee for reference. I saw this in the store and was glad i didn\\'t order it earlier online. i thought it would be beautifully stitched but it was rather flat and unimpressive in person. i like more unusual and flattering pieces, and this just wasn\\'t it. no compliments here. Fits well and appropriate for work or going out! love the pop of red in the beads! could easily be worn with a jacket well into fall! i typically wear a 6 and a small fit perfectly. not too short- but hits above the knee! this will get lots of wear! Disappointed :-(\\nthis top has a boxy shape and looked like a mini moo moo on me. i have a similar shape as the model and it looked nothing like that on me. bummer! i liked the quality and weight (not too heavy nor too light) but shape is unflattering. it\\'s going back. Purchased this top because of the sale. i got it in the peach and the maize. i think it is big, boxy, and loose but at the sale price it is not a bad top to have. the colors are vibrant and striking. pretty with shorts and capris. i did size down from 2 to 0 I love the cardigan. it\\'s super comfy and long enough to cover my behind. the pink and white stripe lining adds a softer touch. it\\'s a little tight in the arms. i\\'m right between a small and medium, i wish i would have ordered the medium. I have purchased a lot from retailer but lately, some of the items have been disappointing in quality.verses cost, this being one. the picture is nice but the actual blouse is nothing like this. the size was not accurate so buy a size bigger because of the sleeves. These shorts just didn\\'t work for me. i loved the embroidery and the color, but i just don\\'t have the curves for them. try these if you have an hourglass or fuller figure. The fabric wrinkles so easily and any slight moisture or liquid immediately turns into a dark spot on the blue grey...condensation drips from a glass, gel deodorant, etc. i tried the cream but it\\'s very sheer. i had to return this dress-- not practical! I had read a few reviews on this shirt before ordering that said it ran small and was shorter than it looks. i thought it was worth finding out because i really liked how this shirt looks in the pictures on the store site. unfortunately, when i got it in the mail and opened it up i found out that all the earlier review were right.\\r\\n\\r\\nit is much shorter than the dimensions implied in the pictures of the model. i was expecting a tunic style shirt that could be worn over leggings or skinny jeans th I am keeping this because i got a great deal (30% off sale price), it fits great (i alternate between xs and s, went with s), and overall it has nice quality (thick fabric, secure toggles, etc.), but--what is with the lack of lining? i would hesitate to buy anything from this brand at full price because of that. there are just large seams on the inside, which is tolerable because of the type of fabric, but come on. I love this skirt, in theory. the style is fun and original and the quality was excellent. however, being suede, the skirt was very bulky. also, at 5\\'8\" and liking skirts to be long enough for work, i typically don\\'t have problems with long length. however, i thought this skirt fit too long on me such that it distracted from the style. i really wanted to love this skirt - hopefully they\\'ll make some updates in future styles. Nicely designed romper with an wide elastic waist band that can be worn on the hips or around the waist. not too short for this 60+ body and very comfy. i wear either a med. or large and went with large for this. a good buy. These looked really interesting online and with the multicolor stripes i thought it would pair nicely with many tops. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe fabric is nice and sturdy. the colors are more vibrant than online. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe design however is terrible. when i put them on i double checked to make sure they weren\\'t on backwards- the back is flat as a board but the front has these poofy pockets. the poor fit with the bright stripes gives a \"1920s circus diaper\" look which is not good. \\r\\n\\r\\nthey\\'re also really tight compar Disappointing, back is yellowish and looks strange. the front view is cute but doesn\\'t match the fabric on the back at all. can\\'t imagine why you would do that? Loved this shirt when i saw the picture. unfortunately fit was not what it needed to be to keep it. you can\\'t really see in the photo but if you have any chest at all (i am only 34b...so would say of average size bust) this shirt will not fit well. there is a seam in the bust area that cuts across the bust which is not flattering/doesn\\'t fit well . the sleeves were also a bit more tight than i\\'d have thought from the photo.\\n\\nreally wanted to love this - but unless you have a smaller chest it lik In a sea of dresses, this is the one that caught my eye in the whole store. i am a pear shape, and ended up trying both the medium and the large, taking the medium home. it was super flattering on, and was an appropriate length to pair with tights.\\n\\nhere\\'s where the problem happened. i wanted to wear this dress for thanksgiving, i put it on, and as i tightened the drawstring to cinch in the waist - riiiiiiiiiip! the drawstring ripped through the fabric at the waistband. so disappointed. Not a pretty blouse - it\\'s quite utilitarian in design - and it runs enormous. This top is so cute but after i added my tank top under neath it made me look frumpy. however, if you pair it with the right tank and bottoms it could be very cute. i think my problem is that i am not long wasted enough. i wish that it had worked because it is so unique. Gorgeous dress, but so low in front and in back...i couldn\\'t figure out how to pull it off without a cardigan/sweater. beautiful fabric and color. This is a cute t with colors that blend with so many things i already have in my closet.\\r\\nand, i love the western theme which isn\\'t at all girly. usually i purchase v-neck items because\\r\\nthey suit me best, but i couldn\\'t pass up the idea of cactus and succulents. it will be a fun\\r\\nshirt to wear. I\\'m 140 at 5\\' 8\". pear shape. the pockets really opened up when i put them on and didn\\'t lay flat. loose on leg opening - which i liked. but the pockets sticking out around the hip area made my pear shape even wider. i got a medium Gorgeous piece, although much longer than it appears to be in the photo. the price, however, is a bit steep. i\\'m not sure that i\\'m going to keep it because i just don\\'t think it looks as expensive as it is. I\\'m 5\\'2 and bought the dress in a petite medium. i like to buy clothes that i can wear to work and this dress was almost too short. if it were any shorter, it wouldn\\'t have worked. if i were to buy it again, i\\'d probably go with a non-petite size. also, i ordered the dress online and i found two snags in it as soon as i pulled it out of the box. i don\\'t think they will be terribly noticeable, but just beware that this dress will apparently snag easily. i plan to wear it with a purse without meta I was looking for a casual dress for quick errands that was trendy but comfy.  this dress had a lot of potential [i was drawn to the print]  but the material is awful. so thin and scratchy! immediately went back. I wanted to wear this for my journey to cuncun and i wanted the blight pink as photo however it was a dark pink which didn\\'t fit to me unfortunately... but the design was pretty! Overall, i was pleased with this dress. i didn\\'t love how the front wrap transitioned to the back. it is comfortable and versatile... it can be dressed up or down. I\\'m 5\\'5\" and got the m. i thought i\\'d need the petite but i decided to try on the regular m in the store and the length was fine (mid calf). i gave a 3 for quality though because all the ones in my store were tearing in the back where the shoulders meet the back. i bought it anyway because it looked like an easy fix and it was so darn cute and comfortable on! I am 5\\'6\" and the neckline barely covers my bra -- would have to wear a cami with it. the fabric is soft, and the colors are very pretty. but the neckline is too low for me for a casual top. What i love especially about this dress are the comfortable, soft fabric and the shape of the back -- the scoop and longer back hem are very ballet dancer! the green & off white print is very pretty for spring. sizing is a little tricky for me as i\\'m between petite and regular sizes. the hem length in the sp is perfect, about 1.5\" above the knee in front, but the waist sits a little high. the top seam of the waist section is above my natural waist, and the bottom seam sits right under my navel s Order a whole size down and this may work. i\\'m normally a 6-8 or a medium but this was huge. ordered the small because i loved the color/design. hopeful! This top has a nice print and material.  being a full figure, it helps when a material stays put instead of being too flowy.  not very keen about the straps.  they\\'re a bit longer for me, so they don\\'t stay on my shoulders.  i\\'ll keep it and adjust the straps. I ordered this pants in white and black. i read the reviews and weren\\'t that bad. i am 5\\'6 and 125 lbs. i got them in size small. they are way too big. the small size seems to be xl and they are way too long for someone who is maybe 5\\'8 or 5\\'9. i have to returned them. quality is ok looking on my opinion. Love this top!\\nit is a full/ swing top, but the slightly shorter length balances out the fullness perfectly.\\ni have been wearing it with a contrasting fitted cami and get tons of compliments.\\nlove both colors, and having fun wearing them.\\nand after one washing the fullness is softer and looks like the pic.\\nruns true to size and in the arms slightly tight, so i went with my usual med and fits perfect.\\nif you have issues with sleeve size would recommend going up a size, otherwise very true to size Was very disappointed with this dress. it\\'s very baggy, no shape. felt like an oversized sack. purchased in med. bust area was only semi good fit all else flopped :( Cute design for a casual top. however it was a little snug on the bust for a medium. i returned it I have been looking at this top online & today i tried it on in the store in a size small and xs regular. i am 5\\'3\", 120 lbs. 34b, and the xs fit better than small. in the small the armholes were too low & showed my bra. this is the regular cut, not even petite (& note i am on the shorter side) & the length was a few inches shorter than i would like. glad i didn\\'t order this online in petite. i love the detail & the material looks wellmade, with the exception of the beading in one spot was alrea First problem-i would not have ordered this at all had the description been correct. the fabric description is cotton which the dress is most certainly not. secondly, it has a really funky, cheap, unfinished, raw-hemmed slip which is simply not fitting for the dress. the keyhole in the front is super long-again, does not seem to fit the dress. i am not happy with this piece at all but it did fit tts. length is just above knee. i am 5\\'5\" 142 lbs 34d and the six was a good fit. sending this home t I bought these on sale and they quickly went back. i was very disappointed after reading the reviews. i thought for sure these would be a winner. however, i was sadly mistaken. i ordered another pair of jeans, the same, from a different brand. these were way too small while my others were too large. they didn\\'t live up to my expectation and were still rather long. even though i bought these on sale, i was not happy with the quality. Wow this is huge! i\\'m all for the tent-look with the right style, but this was absurd. i could have fit two of me into the width, and with the peplum style, extra width doesn\\'t flatter anyone. the fabric is also so thin that it doesn\\'t hang nicely, it kind of floats around the body. if you want a wide top, then this is perfect, but if you wanted something that hangs nicely, look elsewhere. i purchased a petite s, my typical size. This skirt is flattering and so soft. i\\'ve worn it once, and while it did keep feeling like a scandalous slit, i just had to keep reminding myself of the awesome inner skirt. i gave a 4 instead of 5 because my elastic seems to roll ever so slightly in front so that the pleats don\\'t hang flat, and also a little bit of stitching on the outside was loose. since it\\'s nothing that will unravel the whole thing, i\\'m not too worried about it. This skirt is very comfortable and moves well. i\\'m 5\\'4\" and ordered a 2p, which fits perfectly. the length hits just above the top of my feet. the patterned chiffon is sheer and the skirt has a short black slip underneath that ends just above my knees. i have a small waist and wider hips, but found the inner slip to fit loosely enough so that it doesn\\'t ride up when i walk or sit. the two slits on either side were a great length and make this skirt both flirty and quirky. you\\'ll get tons of comp The perfect flowy fall top! the material is thin so it may pick a little, but i love it. The sweater material was fragile. there were already two picks in the fabric when it arrived. i felt like it would not wear or wash well. i was also disappointed in the shaping or how it hung on my body. i am returning the sweater. The shirt is beautiful, but fits much too small. the stitching limits the space in your shoulders, and the hem too short. a petite frame would be able to pull this off- but i am a 5.10\" medium, and the shirt didn\\'t work in every direction. I loved this when i saw it arrive in the mail. as soon as i put it on though, i was drowning in it. i know its a cape and it is suppose to be large but it was so big i had to return it. i still really like it and wish it would have worked. i am 5\\'5, athletic/slim figure just for reference. I was disappointed with this dress because it is not the usual retailer quality. the quality of the material is not very good. i\\'ve bought boiled wood jackets from this brand before and they\\'re very soft and very well made, hence my disappointment. i agree with the other reviewers in that this dress runs very large and the length is short for a winter dress. Just not as long as in the picture. it hit me at my hips not good! I thought this skirt would fit just over the knee with a nice flowy build. instead it fit rather baggy and was longer than i expected. i felt dowdy in it. I purchased this top in the black and tan color, loved the fit, style and fabric. however, it is a loose weave and after just one wearing a hole opened up on the front, which could not be repaired. it was covered by the cowl neck collar but as the day wore on the hole got bagger and it can no longer be hidden. i was very disappointed in the quality of this top- i purchased it at full price and was only able to wear it once. i just didn\\'t have the time to return it to the store. This is a full swing top. because the top is so full, it should hit at or slightly above the waist (and it does on me) so that a pant or skirt waistline can be seen and balance out the proportions. will look great with a pencil skirt or any pant that as a mid or high rise fitted waist and flat front (no pleats or draw string, for example). the fabric has weight and hangs nicely. color is true to photos. easy way to look a little dressier during summer. 5\\'3\" 120lb 34b - small regular fit me perfe Ordered these online and they fit perfectly. i was looking for lightweight pants for hot and humid summer days and this pair is exactly what i needed. the striped pattern is cute and adds some color. Is gigantic-it could be so cute, but the neckline and armholes are ridiculously low. i am 5 feet 10 and 140 pounds, and a small was huge on me. This looked like such a cute, casual skirt when i picked it up but like other reviewers have said, it runs small. i\\'m usually a xs in retailer skirts but they only had a small to try on. i was able to get it on but did notice it was snug pulling on past my hips. however once on, i couldn\\'t figure out how i\\'d wear this. i wouldn\\'t pair this with a flowy top but tucking something in didn\\'t seem like a good idea either. between the pleats and elastic waist it will make almost anyone look like they ha I would have kept this dress if it weren\\'t for the giant arm holes and reveal my entire bra on both sides. other than that, it looks just like it does on the model and is a nice, substantial material. I loved the look of this sweater on-line, but it just didn\\'t work for me. the fit wasn\\'t good enough. the style okay. the color fine. the feel, scratchy. overall, it did not work for my body. Love these! they are thick and comfortable. they feel like sweat pants but are cute enough to wear out if you are running quick errands. definitely recommend! I love the color and style of this dress. and i wanted to love it too? sadly the fabric is truly inferior to the retailer brand and definitely not worth the price of the dress. checked it out in store and so glad i did as it would have been returned for sure. The fit was fine, but the fabric (the beige option) was bland. it washed me out. granted, i\\'m fair skinned, but it reminded me of sour milk. it\\'s getting returned. Online, i like the design, the leaves stand out. in-person, the leaves don\\'t stand out as much, you can barely see them they are so light. the top is slightly see-through. the price is high. i think this top would work better on a more slender frame. i like the top but the price is too high for the quality and thin fabric. it may look better on a slender frame, i think. it was just too light and thin for me. I assumed at the price point this would be a high quality t-shirt/sweater. unfortunately, it is made of cheap looking material that is 50% acrylic and see-through. I like the feel and color of this blouse. however, i was very disappointed with the sizing. i usually wear medium so i ordered medium for this blouse, it fits way too big. it is a bummer because the \"curve\" is not even visible when i wear it. It\\'s a great addition for summer. defiantly need a tank on under it but very pretty. I ordered this in size xl and it is now a favorite of mine. the sleeves are tighter on me than pictured. i\\'ve had great luck with this brand and was a little surprised that the sleeves were cut tighter than typical. the material has a little give so i was able to stretch that out a bit. everything else was true-to-size. the sleeves are a little long but i don\\'t need to cuff them.\\n\\nthe lace detail & the peplum are so pretty. it\\'s a perfect option for cold weather. it did shrink a little, even wit This shirt was tent like on me and there was really no way around it. i am fairly small- usually a 4 or 6 in tops, and smaller on top- barely 34b. this top was incredibly unflattering, falling to cut right at my hips and sitting open and way too flowy-- like a pillowcase/sacklike fit. there was just too much fabric here to make it work for me. it\\'s unfortunate because it looks adorable in the product photo and i love the plaid mix with the open shoulders- a nice transition to fall. unfortunately I ordered this in size xl. the fit is true to size. it fits me as it does on the model. the draping is very flattering. i\\'m a pear-shape and this shape works well. it definitely needs a tank underneath. you could sew a bit of the top to keep it closed. otherwise, everything can show. i like using different colored tanks to pull out the colors in the pattern.\\r\\nthe quality of the material is outstanding. the print looks so much prettier in person. it\\'s very vibrant. the photos online, at least on I love this top! the color is quite unique (a reddish color), but the cut really makes it stand out. i love the square neckline. i feel it accentuates my bust without showing too must breast. i notice a number of other reviewers had an issue with the tightness around the bust: this top looks like it would have ample stretch in the photograph; however, in person you can see that the embroidered area does not have any stretch. for me, this was not an issue, as the top suited my body type well rega Oh elevenses, i love your pants..the fabrics, the details, the length. i\\'ve found elevenses to be classic work pants. reliable, professional, well made. these are none of those things. the cardinal trousers are thin and the rise feels much higher that\\'s it appears in the picture. the red pair are thin, stretchy and cheap. both pairs have to go back. i\\'m truly sad. When i tried this top on, i started laughing. the two rows of ruffles are made of a starchy thick cotton, which, instead of falling by the hips, juts out like wings. it\\'s also huge. cute idea, wrong material and placement. I tried this blouse on in the store and chose not to purchase it. i did not think the fabric or design warranted the price point as it felt a bit cheap and there\\'s not much to the design. it is true to size - my usual size 4 fit well enough. i\\'m on the tall side with an average bust and i did not find it short. my friend was shopping with me and she thought it looked maternity on her as she is thin but very well endowed. she also thought it made her shoulders look broad. personally i liked it on I normally wear a xs, but i got a small so it would be a little longer. great quality and adorable! The image does not show but the front of the dress has a heavy 24\" utility zipper hidden with 5 snaps. the zipper pull, when closed, sat right on my collarbone, which was he height of discomfort. it felt heavy and awkward. the dress was very high waisted for me (i\\'m 5\\'6\" and it was 3\" inches above the navel)) also to the point of discomfort.\\n\\nan invisible side zipper would have made the difference for me if the proportions were better suited for a non-petite sizing.\\n\\nthe fabric is quite beautifu Wow, i wish this would have worked for me. the pom details are truly adorable and give the sweater that extra added touch. i agree with the other reviewer that the \"crop\" style is almost too much and gives an awkward fit. i am short, 5\\'2\" so it cut me off in the wrong area (i bought a petite xs). the material is delicate but that is part of the charm so i didn\\'t have a problem with that at al. my problem was the fit-- a bit too boxy for my build. wish it would have worked but i\\'ll have to admire This skirt is gianormous! i usually take an xl or l, so i ordered both. the waistband on the xl was so huge, i didn\\'t even try it on. i feared it would not stay up! so i tried the large, and it was big as well. i think i would have needed a medium. but as it is, it is not the cute a-line that appears in the picture. (i wonder how they even got it to look like that !?!?!) it is huge, hip-y, and bunchy. yuck. I was so so excited to get this sweater in the mail. unfortunately, the sweater is lined with the same material (very soft and warm btw) as the polka dots, which sheds like crazy. i wore a white tshirt under this for the first time, and my shirt was covered in black fuzz by the end of the day. so much so that i was gathering balls of it to be thrown away. very disappointed. a lint roller can\\'t even clean up the tshirt.\\n\\nin terms of sizing, this fits tts, i normally wear a l or xl, got this in an Love the design and print. absolutely beautiful bathing suit. would size up on the bottoms. top is true to size. I tried this on when i saw it hanging in the dressing room. i was pleasantly surprised by this piece. the color is beautiful - not too yellow - not too brown. i have not worn it yet so i\\'m assuming it will hold up pretty well considering my other pieces from this designer are still looking good with several wears. i bought this in a small size so it does not hang down like it does on the model. perhaps that\\'s why i don\\'t need a cami underneath. Just got this shirt in the mail and i am absolutely in love! i paired it with jeans and brown boots and got so many compliments. the shirt is light and flowy. it very flattering for any body shape. Seemed pretty shapeless which surprised me because of the design. perhaps it was just too big. returned it. This shirt was so weird?it does not fit like the photo at all. there seems to be missing a stitch or something at the top as it is wide open until the bottom/where it meets the other layer. i could wear a tank/camisole underneath, but it still just did not fit right. i do not have a large chest, but this was ridiculous. beyond that, the red color was just okay. even though i purchased this on sale, it was not worth the price and i returned. Very flattering ang comfy but they do run slightly big. i stayed with my true size because i am thicker in waist but if small waisted size down. fit ty\\'s in legs and bottom. love color! This pajama-like dress is not worth $150 (full price plus tax in texas), so i can\\'t really justify keeping it. i kept having to pull it over on one side so it would align correctly. it also runs big. i bought the m (which i am returning) and it bunches at the waist but the length was perfect. the s is too short on the bottom. i love the color, but it\\'s going back. i\\'d buy it if it were on sale. Bought these for the color however these just did not work for me. the 26 was too small and the 27 was baggy. i\\'m 5\\'3 and typically wear a 26. beautiful color and good denim. if you are looking for a looser fit, more of a straight leg fit...this is a good jean with a fun pop of color. I was excited to see this top, ordered it and was disappointed. it was too tight across the chest and had too much fabric around the bottom. i tried this on 3 times hoping for i had been wrong in previous assessments- no luck. I purchased this dress as an easy option to throw on after the gym or on a weekend trip without fuss. the fabric is soft, hangs well, and it is well-lined. but it\\'s also a little more bilious than perhaps necessary to be beautiful and flowing. as in, i\\'m very comfortable in this dress, but it\\'s not a dress i receive compliments while wearing. perhaps it reads as maternity wear without the belt. I wish i would have read the other reviews before ordering. it\\'s cute, but very casual and very thin material...not like other retailer tops. also runs super small. i ordered a small (i wear a small or xsmall at retailer) and will likely jump to a large given feedback in other reviews. This looks like the perfect easy sweater with the white shirt appeal to it, but sadly the fit of this number is really off. it looks more like a tent. it must have been clipped in the back or something. i cannot see any scenario in which this would look good... I bought this in size xl. it is so much bigger than i expected. there are panels of material. it really is huge. not flattering at all. still, i kept it. the material is so soft & flowy. i\\'ve gotten good use wearing it around the house, doing chores, resting, etc. i wouldn\\'t wear it out doing errands. but, around home, it\\'s perfect for feeling cozy. such a strange cut. i don\\'t know who would look good in it since it can look sloppy. i think many would enjoy wearing it at home. Material is too thin and quality is poor I\\'m not sure why this dress is getting great reviews. the plunging neckline is ridiculous and ran down to the underwire of my bra and the slit up the side came up to the upper part of my thigh. it was one of the worst fitting/cut dresses i\\'ve every tried on at retailer. i\\'m 5\\'4 125. maybe you have to be 6 feet tall and 90 pounds for this dress to not look like a bad renaissance faire costume. It\\'s short and wide. not a good combo for anyone who isn\\'t stick thin. I was so excited for this dress to arrive, but when it did, it was a major disappointment. there is no lining on the skirt portion of the dress leaving it sheer. also, the top part along the chest puckered in a weird unflattering way. the colors were beautiful, but not enough to to make up for the other design flaws. i am 5\\'6\" 140lb and the small fit tts. will be sending it back This shell can be worn casual or dressy depending on what it is paired with. enjoy! Much lower quality than other robes i have purchased I thought i might like the look of this oversized odette dress but after i tried it on i felt it was not a flattering style on me. the color was pretty and fabric was nice - just not a fit for me. I ordered the large since the med wasn\\'t available and it didn\\'t complement my figure because it was too loose all over. i like the design detail with off-center buttons and the fabric is a nice quality. Extremely pretty swimsuit, gorgeous cut in the front with the lace and the floral print, very flattering to hourglass shapes. coverage across rear end is a bit less than i would prefer, but it\\'s so very pretty that i\\'m keeping it. several comments from friends that this could be worn as a tank top for regular wear it is so pretty. In the quest to find comfy, cute, casual tops i took a change on this one. it\\'s cute but quite oversized. it just overwhelmed me. i ordered the large and generally wear medium or large so you can safely size down at least a size or two and still get the fit shown on the model. the style and color just didn\\'t suit my coloring or body type,  but i still recommend because it\\'s comfortable and different enough to be a nice addition to someone else\\'s closet. The fabric and color are absolutely beautiful. the shape of the dress is strange - fitted and tight through the waist, and enormous everywhere else. it was not flattering. Great fit even for busty women. ordered an 8 because i usually need the room in the chest area on dresses.(36d-dd) fit nicely without being tight. might have been able to size down but i didn\\'t want to risk being too tight. flattering especially on curves. nice for contemporary office or special occasion. if you like his designs, you won\\'t be disappointed! I ordered these without reading the previous reviews and i would have to agree with everything everyone has already said. these are the cutest cords i\\'ve seen in a long time! they\\'re definitely skinny, bridging on way too skinny through the calves but i\\'m willing to stick it out. the thing that bugs me about them is how stinking short they are?? the description doesn\\'t really mention that they\\'re crops but at this length any ankle bootie is going to be too short. also, they aren\\'t navy. they\\'re I bought the one with blue and white top and black bottom. absolutely loved it! i am 5\"2 so the dress is part is a bit long for me---ended up wearing my 4.5 inch heels to make it fit. the fabric is more heavy than what it seems in the pictures. but that makes it more formal. it\\'s great! This dress overwhelmed me. i\\'m 5 feet tall and the print and material just took over. I\\'d been looking for a replacement for my faux leather jacket and this has surpassed my expectations. well-made, lovely color, very soft, flattering cut. it runs small so i sized up from my usual petite xs to a petite s. it\\'s warm and the lining is very pretty. hopefully it\\'ll hold up to daily wear. i\\'d definitely recommend it as a great jacket to take you from fall - spring. i got the plum color. Ok ladies....you need to know that this type of fabric is the one that will get holes (i bought the white one). it is super thin and lovely, but i was only able to get two wears out of it. i did wash it and it maintained it\\'s size because i restretched it while wet then hung to dry. i was super disappointed about the wear but appreciated being able to return it without question at my local retailer. I saw this dress in the catalog and immediately ran to the store to purchase. then i realized the dress in the catalog is slightly different, but the small differences is what makes the catalog dress so much more unique and worth the money! look at the top, the stripe colors are different. and the stripes flow different on the skirt part as well. and the dress was short on me and i\\'m two inches shorter than the model. bummer. The color is as pictured. good quality. it\\'s lined. the zipper in the back makes it look updated. i ordered my usual size. small petite size 6. it fit perfectly. i\\'m 5 feet and 120 lbs. hourglass figure. i had high hopes. i have hips and short, heavy legs. the skirt only emphasized my flaws. if you\\'ve got great legs you will do well with this. i do own other short skirts. but the fact that is less tailored in look makes it better suited for a younger gal. if you\\'re on the fence give it a try. it The fit is really flattering and cute but the fabric and finishings seem really cheap. it\\'s a printed plaid - not woven. I loved the look of this dress online so i went to retailer to try it on. in the dressing room area we were all laughing because (i tried on a small) when i got it tied to the point where it looked like the model online i couldn\\'t raise my arms. the distance between the cuff and the waist is inches! even if you manage to lift your arms the whole dress will go with it and expose you as much as if you weren\\'t wearing a dress at all but a shirt. too bad. poor design for sure, and such a shame when th I love the style and quality of this blouse. it can easily be dressed up or down. the blouse is completely see through and delicate. still, it is so romantic, feminine, distinctive and timeless. What a shame this dress is. i wear xl and am 5\\'2\", but the dress in the store in the size xs(!!!!!) looked just the right size. yup! xs was just the right size. i can\\'t imagine anyone who wears m or s finding this dress fit flattering. it would look like a sack. it is an inch or two too short in the front for me, so i\\'ll be returning it. I so wanted to love the striped peplum top, however i have a petite frame with a large chest and there was absolutely no support in the top. not flattering in the least for a d-dd cup. will be returning. i imagine this would be perfect for someone with a frame like mary kate or ashley olsen :) I am always on the hunt for a cute white t-shirt but this one was a miss. it is too boxy (short) and the material is very thin for the price. i gave it two stars because it has nice colors for spring/summer. for reference, i am 5\\'4 and 115 lbs and i ordered a small. bought it online so i ended up returning it to the store. Billowy top - perfect for casual comfort. the topic is definitely not raspberry-- it is a sunset orange. disappointed as i was going for a match. i should have gone off of the picture and not the color name. The bright poppy red is gorgeous and the cut flattering and interesting. i\\'m usually between a m and l in tops but went with a s in this one because it looked too sloppy in my usual size. i\\'m a 32-34 d with arms that aren\\'t tiny, and it\\'s a bit tight across the shoulders when i reach forward but not enough to be a problem. in the smaller size it skims my hips nicely but isn\\'t as long as pictured on the model. i would suggest pear-shaped girls size down if in-between. it is sheer but not so much I ordered this dress online and did not realize it had beaded details on the bodice... gorgeous dress - perfect for festival season. I love this t shirt and have not purchased it in all 3 colors. very soft and very flattering!!! i like the longer length as well as the pretty neckline. A $200 piece of polyester with no shape and looks good only on the model. avoid ! mine went back the same day it came in the mail... I like the casual look of this top.\\nlike previous review - it doesn\\'t have buttons or zipper, so a little difficult to fit into - pullover your head. I bought 3 shirts in gold, black and red. they arrived larger than expected. after the first wash and air dry they shrunk. i would have been thrilled but they shrunk to be shorter while staying too wide. also my black shirt faded a lot with one wash. This skirt looks and feels cheap, and the color is much more green than pictured. additionally, i comfortably wore a size 4 and then lost a few pounds, and this is still way too tight to be flattering. I wanted to love this dress, however it has no shape to it. it is also somewhat see through, so something needs to be worn under it. i feel like i received a dress that has been stretched out and returned. i\\'m extremely disappointed. i do not recommend. The structure makes this fit perfectly. the details are also lovely, and it is soft and well-made. it is a little sheer, but i felt comfortable enough to wear it with just a black bra underneath. if you are between sizes, i would probably size up. This top is even better than pictured. the colors are brighter, though still natural. this allows lots of possibilities with pairing bottoms to it. i ordered a large (my usual size) and would say it\\'s pretty loose, but doesn\\'t look ridiculous. it just hangs well and fits the way it should. the fabric is a little thin so you\\'ll need a shade shirt or tank under it if you don\\'t want your bra to show through. I saw this dress and had to have it. it is very cute and comfortable. i have fuller hips, so i\\'m not sure about the stripe across the widest section of my body. the arm holes are a little gaping as well as other reviewers have mentioned. i bought the medium which fits well everywhere, but the arm holes. i think the small would fit me everywhere, but the hips. so, i\\'m on the fence of whether to keep it. i do like the dress and it is of good quality; it just may not be the right fit for me. i\\'m a But the back of it, by the waist, bunches just a tiny bit. if i get bigger, it will be too long. but i love the skirt, it is flattering and cute. not itchy for me even if the title says wool. i ordered the 00p and the length is pretty much as pictured, just below the knee in front. the waist is snug, bigger it would fall more on my hips (hence the too long comment earlier. (115 lbs, 26-27 in waist, short legs...) I tried these on in a 6 which is my usual size in bottoms that are not designer jeans and they fit ok. they were a little short waisted but i have a long torso. sizing up to an 8 helped but then they were fairly wide in the legs. they are meant to flare out a bit i believe but it was too much for me. i like them but i don\\'t love. Color is not like photo and fit doesn\\'t work if you\\'re busty Great sweater but it was just a little too short on me so it is going back. it is extremely fuzzy and soft though. Love this top!! so comfy and flattering. i ordered the black and the blue and i am itching to get the red/purple one too! I am sooooooo massively disappointed in this purchase. i thought i had found the perfect pant in this style. both more comfortable and more flattering than similar styles in the store. i wanted to wear them every day; received lots of compliments; felt that you could dress up or down; etc. this is where i have to admit that i wore them several times straight from the store before washing. on the second wear, i noticed threads coming out on the seams, but just on one side of one leg. this was irr Very cute dress, but fabric is very flimsy and seams were very puckered which couldn\\'t be pressed out. Perfect for the weekend, purchased the purple, it is a nice soft purple, great with jeans. xs petite was perfect. (115 lbs) I love these jeans, cant believe i never purchased them earlier. i\\'m always a 30 in paige and ag and this was no different. i will say that i did fit into the 29, so it could be that they run slightly large. the fabric is amazing!! and the white is perfect. love that it is not see through and fabric is substantial.the length for me at 5\\'5 was at my ankle. i loved them so much that i bought them in white and beige/cream. highly recommend. Material is so thin this shirt ripped in three places after wearing only once.\\r\\n\\r\\ngot a size larger than i needed as i have a larger chest and even though it\\'s a bit lose the thread has ripped material on my chest and in the armpits. This piece is a winner solely b/c of the sleeves. otherwise, it\\'s a plain, large tee. however, the sleeves are gorgeous and so unique! had they had my size left, i would have purchased in other colors (i got pink). it runs large, so size down. Totally see through. I love this dress. i think the cut, fabric and embroidery are all flattering. this dress is comfortable and can be dressed up or down. i am 5\\'1 and weigh anywhere from 108-113 lbs. i at first tried on the xxs petite and liked the look but found it to be tight in the arm area. they didn\\'t have an xs petite so i tried on the s petite to see if there was any major difference. there totally was! so i ordered the xs petite online and can\\'t wait to get it!! The catalog shot and model shot are completely different. it\\'s like not even the same dress. the neckline, color, the quality of lace I went to the store to try on a jumpsuit and ended up with these instead. while the jumpsuit was really cute, i thought these would be more versatile. as far as i can tell they are the same style as the pradollano tapered loungers by hei hei. these were so cute and comfy i bought both. they can easily be dressed up with a jacket and heels or worn casually with a tee and sandals. i think these are much cuter in person than online. there is a little red design in the pants which is hard to see in Got the mustard and grey. very cute. looking forward to wearing it I was disappointed with this dress because it is not the usual retailer quality. the quality of the material is not very good. i\\'ve bought boiled wood jackets from this brand before and they\\'re very soft and very well made, hence my disappointment. i agree with the other reviewers in that this dress runs very large and the length is short for a winter dress. The fit is true to size. the quality is nice. i am happy to having this basic wardrobe staple added to my closet! Completely oversized top, size medium was swimming on me.....boxy, baggy, shapeless -- what more can i say? even in an xs this would not have fit in any way like the photo, returned. Just received yesterday & i love this skirt! it\\'s crazy soft, very flow-y and the higher slits on each side let it be more sexy than hippie-looking which i appreciate. great to pair with a funky pair of tights underneath. sits nicely on your body - hugs your curves.\\n\\nonly annoyance is it\\'s a bit awkward to walk in as the material moves around your legs & gets caught a bit. you definitely have to be conscious of it as you walk.\\n\\ni bought a m in gray which fit perfectly (i\\'m 5\\'9\" & usually a 6). t Didn\\'t love it, didn\\'t hate, rather indifferent. the grey was a little more muted than i wanted for a summer tee.\\r\\ni\\'m 5\\'4\", 123lbs, 34a, the xs fit if it wouldn\\'t shrink, if you\\'re about this size but larger busted go with the s. Just gorgeous . this is one beautiful top. the colors are pretty and vibrant. i wear either a large or xl and the large was great in this top. dress it up or down.this top flows and it drapes beautifully in the back. it looks fantastic with jeans. as a bonus it is lined so no need for any type of piece under it. it\\'s an all year round top. throw a cardigan or wrap over it when the weather cools down and you are set to go. a great top for your wardrobe . i would not hesitant to buy it. Granted that i am not as reed thin, or as young, as the model. but i am tall and reasonably slender. i have long hands and small wrists, which would be a factor in the overall effect of this garment. this poncho looked like some sad old stretched out who-knows-what that you\\'d keep in the car for emergency purposes, in case you needed warmth if the car broke down in a snowstorm -- and i have one of those foldable reflective blankets in the glove box for that purpose. i was looking for a statement This dress looked adorable online, but unfortunately, it\\'s not flattering at all, and it\\'s completely see-through. completely. the material is so thin that i can\\'t imagine it would hold up very well over time. this one is definitely going back. I\\'m 5\\'4, 115 and the xs swallowed me like a snuggie. i suppose the tons of fabric might drape nicely if you\\'re 5\\'8 and above? it drooped and hung comically large from every angle under arm, body and skirt. a belt was no match for that much fabric. the colors are gorgeous and it appeared well made, but the design was awful. I love this tee. really comfortable and super cute too! This skirt is really cute and very comfortable. i can dress it up for work or dress it down for casual. fun color too. I ordered this pullover in green, size large. the color is lovely and the fabric feels great. however, it was tight (even though i often wear a medium). unfortunately it will be going back. I\\'m still on the fence about these. i realize they got great reviews but i thought they would be a bit thicker. they just feel too flimsy and too much like i\\'m ready for bed. i was looking for more lounge pants that i felt like if i needed to run up to the store on a saturday afternoon that i wasn\\'t wearing pjs. i just can\\'t get past that. they are totally cute but i was definitely looking for more summer lounge-wear.\\r\\n\\r\\ni ordered the small which fit fine. i wear 4-6 in retailer pants. i got the p Online this top looks fabulous, but in person, not so great. great color, nice quality for a lightweight top, but when i tried it on, the neck does not lay nicely. too much sloppy wrinkled material just hanging awkwardly around the neck ( and i love cowl neck). i found, for me, it dipped very low showing cleavage and i have a large chest, so didn\\'t work. for reference, i\\'m 5\\'4 118 and usually wear a small in retailer tops because it seems the majority of their clothes run large. i purchased a smal This dress was so pretty on the hanger but a saggy sack on. even the sz 0 was too loose and shapeless. there is no waist as pictured. the hi-low hem, loose fit and wavy waist seam (see in the third close-up picture) make it look like the dress shrunk oddly in the wash. it\\'s really too bad, it\\'s such a pretty combination of patterns. I was able to get this on sale. when it arrived, it was missing half of the rhinestones. i am very surprised that this top would be sent out this way. it also was missing the little bag with extra stones. i\\'m reaching out and wondering if anyone else has experienced this and is there a store that sells rhinestones like the one on the blouse? any help from anyone would be appreciated. i hate to part with this, but where was quality control? Just a warning. i am always a 6 or 8 and even the 8 was so tight in the waist i could barely out this on. if you don\\'t have a super tiny upper waist, this won\\'t fit well. too bad, because it\\'s super cute, if a bit sheer. This sweater is amazing. color is vibrant. quality is high. but i have a super long torso and it fell short on me. if you are shorter this will be amazing. sad to send it back. This is my favorite kind of dress: comfortable, unique, and can dress up or down. i am 5\\'2 and 100 lb, and bought the regular 0 because there were no petites available. it fit perfectly! the material is buttery soft and looks like it will hold up well, and i love the orange-red color. the tie detail makes this dress stand out and i find the cut very flattering. so glad i ordered it!! I bought this jacket in the grey blue color and i absolutely love it. it is warm an sophisticated and versatile. i am 5\\'4\" and 160 lbs and the medium was good for me. I got this dress in navy for my engagement photos and i got so many compliments on the design and fit of the dress. it\\'s very comfortable and stretchy so i got a 6 petite and it fit perfectly, where normally i need an 8 or a 10 because clothes are made so tight now. it was light weight and fit great in the bust and fell nicely over the hips. and for the bottom of the dress being white, it surprisingly wasn\\'t see through. i wouldn\\'t go wearing bright red under the dress but there is definitely no I love this shirt\\'s color which is a lovely yellow. the fit is nice and flowing. i usually wear xs but intentionally bought s, so that it would be a little lose and i may wear with leggings. my one issue is how transparent it is. i opt to wear a spaghetti strap underneath it, however some women might be ok wearing it alone. A lovely sweatshirt with mesh front and back cover with soucotache (sp?) handwork, with a touch of sequins for some pop! the knit sleeves are thin, but the top has some weight due to the detailing on the front and back.\\n\\nthe fit is tts and as shown on the model. it lays comfortable but it\\'s not really baggy.\\n\\nreally lovely. glad i bought one before it was sold out. This dress is cute and comfortable. big but not too big, skimming. i usually wear a 12 pant and bought a medium and it is great. i am on the taller side and the length was great too. I love this top, but i do need to wear a navy cami underneath.  as the pic shows, the lace in the mid section makes it completely sheer in place... kinda odd placement in my opinion. but if you don\\'t mind the sheerness or a cami, it\\'s a great top. The skirt that i received had very little blue or green in it, and was mostly white, yellow and some red. the fit was fine but the quality for the price was not there for me. the lack of quality and the disappointment in the quality equals a return. The model makes this dress look amazing, but it didn\\'t translate that way on me. the print is really beautiful, i loved that, but the waist is huge and the skirt part is a-line and full, not streamlined like it looks on the model. if it was more like that this dress would be a hit. but, sadly, it\\'s a miss. this is something your mom would love on you, but few others. I am 5\\'-7\" and 135 lbs, i bought a medium petite as i wanted the dress to hit at my knees, instead of midi. this dress is easily 2 sizes bigger than expected. the pattern was not flattering on my although i\\'m sure it would be for others. i was happy with the length... Got this in the mail today and while the design is cute, it\\'s not as soft and comfortable as i would like. the front clasp takes a bit of practice to get on and off. the straps are a bit thin and hurts a bit. Not as cute as photos, and too small in chest. i am 5\\'5\\'\\', 125 lbs, and the small was too tight in the chest, and i am not large here at all. shoulders and sleeve length fit well. will return. not comfortable, and will need to be able to button it on rainy days. I was disappointed with this dress because it is not the usual retailer quality. the quality of the material is not very good. i\\'ve bought boiled wood jackets from this brand before and they\\'re very soft and very well made, hence my disappointment. i agree with the other reviewers in that this dress runs very large and the length is short for a winter dress. I loved this top when i laid eyes on it online, and in person, it did not disappoint. it is a beautiful and unique top. the color is striking and the style is adorable. i can\\'t wait to wear this with some flare jeans and espadrilles. Hello i could not see how this dress could get anything but a 5 star review . the only thing that i thought would be a negative is that it may stag easily. other than that this dress is stunning on and i feel it runs large . i wear a sz 4 and the xs fit just right i\\'m 5ft 6in tall looks great with a high heel since its really long to the floor which i like as far as the shine on this dress. i love it it makes it worth the price and dresses up a casual dress . and its very comfortable . Nice dark indigo with minimal fading. medium denim thickness, with stretch. i bought size 25 and it is snug, but doesn\\'t squeeze. my hip is 34.5\" and 28\" waist. love these. i will be getting them hemmed up to ankle length. i am 5\\' 5\" and find the little kick out at the ankle (from getting them shortened) to be very cute and classy. if you keep them full length to your shoe, they will have a slightly baggier bootcut look. these remind me of my point sur hightower straight leg jeans, with maybe an Agree with previous reviewer. i am usually an xs p in this brand (5\\'3\" 115 lbs) but i could not get the internal slip over my head. the chest area was fitted (i am a 32b) but then the skirt was very full and loose. i could have cut out the slip, but worried it would be see through and just not worth it at full price. I was so excited to try these on at my local retailer. i\\'m so glad i did before i ordered them online because i found the fit to be totally off. the pants bulged around my hips and looked very awkward. they were also not as soft as i expected them to be. Pretty top, i like the flutter sleeve design.  the linen is thin- too sheer to not wear a cami underneath the white.  nice for the sale price.  can easily be dressed up or down. This vest looked so cute online but it\\'s a disaster. the quilting is so bulky that the drawstring doesn\\'t work properly and it just hangs. itlooks like something out of a costume closet that could be used for a peasant farmhand or a zombie movie. seriously, it\\'s bad. This shirt appears nice in the pictures. it appears to have a bit of style. wrong. the shirt is one of the thinnest fabrics i\\'ve ever purchased. i live in warmer climate and its nice to have different cotton shirts with some style. this shirt has no style, and i thought it would. i have purchased this brand before, and thought this fabric would be similar. the other shirts were way nicer, softer, and had a different level of construction. i wanted to wear this shirt out and when i put it on it w Love this top! but unfortunately i returned it for exchange coz it was too small for me. hoping there\\'s a sz sm in stock. The sweater is prettier in person than online. great quality, tight knit, overall good purchase. however, it does run small. i would absolutely size up. i am a size 4 with a 34 c chest and i ordered a m and i would have been happy with a roomier l. i was going to return to my local store but they were sold out in the larger sizes.\\ni will keep it because it\\'s gorgeous and i\\'ll make do with the less relaxed fit, but it doesn\\'t look on me like it does on the model. I bought these stretchy skinny cords in my usual size 28 (31 waist, 33 low waist, 38.5 hip/butt).  they are comfortable and long enough for my 5\\' 9\" frame.  i hope they don\\'t shrink.  the flower pattern on all the pairs in the store has the flowers running down the inside and outside of my legs.  the dark part runs down the middle.  i wish it was like the picture on the model, with the print running right down the front and backs of the legs, dark parts on inner and outer thigh. I thought this dress looked gorgeous on the model. so floaty and light. when it came, i found it to be the exact opposite. the hem is so heavy and laid on me like a potato sack. it had way too much material at the bottom and weighed me down unfortunately. This fabric is the same as the turtleneck swing dress by maeve. it\\'s lightweight and stretchy. the problem with this particular dress is the pattern in the fabric will be a little different on each dress depending on how the pattern was cut when it was made. i had to try on 5 different dresses to find one that was cut so the pattern looked and fell in the right spots when wearing the dress. hence 4 stars. the bodice is lined but the skirt itself is not. it is not see through. i\\'m 5\\'4\" and 120#. I\\'m sure there\\'s someone out there who will look good in this but it certainly wasn\\'t me. admittedly, i\\'m a less than ideal body type at a curvy 5\\' tall. still for a taller person this shirt runs short, for a curvy person this does nothing to accentuate a waist, for a short person this pattern is very busy even if the colors are beautiful, for a busty person the gathers around the chest make for a very frumpy look, and even for a short and thin person this shirt runs too big to get a good fit. c I chose to ignore the other reviews saying this shirt was too wide thinking that my wider shoulders would fill it out, but that\\'s not the case. the shirt is adorable and soft and cute on, but just too wide around the armpit/chest area and with the horizontal stripes it just didn\\'t look attractive. i would love to try the next size down to see if it works, but the black and white xxs is sold out so back it went. i am only 5\\'4\" with a shorter torso so the length was fine for me. These trousers are not lined. there is a wide elastic band that runs along the inside of these slacks that is not tacked down, which is a little cheap and probably to keep the price down but doesn\\'t affect the overall fit. and they do fit nice. when your putting them on the fabric bunches at the crotch but then slims out after you zip them (zips up the back.) the fabric has some spandex in it but the lyocell makes them a great choice for work. they hit my ankle a bit lower than on the model. i\\'m I bought this online so didn\\'t realize that the fabric at the bottom is very, very stiff. i was expecting something silky, or at least on the softer and more moveable side. the best description i can think of is an overly starched mens dress shirt. that being the case, it kind of juts out in weird places. the sweater part is very nice, but it is somewhat closer fitting than what it seems in the picture. the fabric bottom is too ample for the slimmer design of the sweater which just adds to the o This top is so good i bought every. single. color. i sized up for more flow but it does run true to size. this is that sweet little summer top that we all long for! I ordered this blouse because it was such a good price on sale but should have paid closer attention to the reviews. the slits on the sleeves are much more noticeable than in the photo and the blouse just didn\\'t work for me. something about it reminded me of seinfeld\\'s pirate shirt. i appreciate retailer\\'s return policy. i took it back to the store and got an immediate refund on my cc. So unflattering! really disappointed. made me look 6 month pregnant and i\\'m a petite size 2. This is a cute top but i wore it for around 5 hours and lo and behold i had smurf skin. i did not sweat in it but the color transferred to my underarm area and bra and it did not come off in the shower!! i guess it\\'s going to have to wear off. thank goodness it was not a hot day!! i hope that i can return it. It\\'s thin knit with a unique and pretty neckline, but unfortunately it\\'s scratchy will not last. i just received it and it looks like it would fall apart after a few wears. it\\'s a nice shade of offwhite at least. for me it\\'s a no that will get sent back straight away. Recommend this vest - nice design - fabric is thicker than expected - might suggest a size smaller - plenty of room in loose styling I love this top. it\\'s so soft and the cut is so flattering for a sweater! the sleeve holes are low enough so that you could easily layer underneath it but high enough to be work alone. the knit is a perfect fall thickeness...warm but not too thick. i am 5\\'11\" 130lbs and i got the medium for the extra length. I tried on this sweater in the store and immediately ordered my size. i got the petite small in natural delivered to my door several days later and am extremely pleased. the fit is roomy enough to layer, but not too large or boxy. the wool is fluffy and luxurious and has terrific appeal. i get compliments every time i wear it...\"classic,\" \"fancy,\" \"jackie o.\" are all terms i heard used to describe my favorite new sweater. the coat is made from a medium weight wool and is probably not meant for e This is definitely again, a bit big. i\\'m usually a med, that is what i got, i could have gotten a small, but the arm holes might have been a tad tight then. i\\'m keeping the med, in case it shrinks, as it is part rayon, and rayon always shrinks if put in the washer. it is a great casual piece that will go with most anything. i love the tie, as you can then tighten the waist up a bit, or leave looser. the material is soft and not clingy. this is why i love a rayon blend. it hits me below my waist Cute but classy top because of the embroidery at the bottom! These pants are so cute and comfortable that i ordered each color.  after wearing the black ones one day, they stretched out so badly that i returned the other two colors.  i wish the fabric was thicker with more stretch because the style and cut is really cute. bummer I loved the mauve color! i loved the idea of the heathered fabric and lace insets, but the linen was rough and scratchy. my regular size was boxy and a little too short! \\r\\n\\r\\nsize: i ordered my normal size small for retailer brands! i\\'m 5\\'4\" tall, approx. 135 lbs, 35-29-36, 34d, long torso. \\r\\n\\r\\nfit: i was swimming in size small! the cut was boxy and unflattering on me. very wide through the chest. it kind of hung on me. the length was a bit short for my liking. \\r\\n\\r\\nif i were to size down, i would b I love this t-shirt because it has the combination of elegance and relazation to a \"t\".\\r\\nit\\'s soft, pretty and covers my wide bottom well. This top looks much nicer on the model than in-person. i tried it on, it didn\\'t look flattering and was shorter than i like. in the picture i really like the top with the design and frills on the side, gives the model a waist. in-person the design doesn\\'t stand out much and the frills look wrinkled.it is also sweatshirt material and a tad stiff. i am sending it back. it just didn\\'t look as flattering. also, it seemed more fitted at the top than bottom. Oh my god - i love this skirt. i first order the size 4 and immediately called customer service and had them send me a 2. i found it be be both plenty stretchy (great for moving, sitting, etc) but runs on the large size. but the fit is amazing. i love the length - a perfect knee-skimmer for me (5\\'9\"). i love the color (green) and the pockets and button fly are so fun without being too much! i\\'ve tried it on with several tops and sweaters in my closet and this skirt is going to be one that i can Has anyone tried to hand wash this dress instead of dryclean?\\r\\nruns a little large. i am 5\\'5 135# 34dd and purchased xs. i was really surprised that xs fits well. i initially tried small but the armholes were too big. the waist is a little too high but i plan to wear it with a belt. I\\'m a vest lover of all shapes, lengths and styles so i had big plans for this vest.  in the end, the pockets ended up ruining the lay and line of this vest.  they are too bulky and end up pulling at the front of the vest, drawing your eye to the pockets and not the neckline.  i agree with previous reviews that it could be worn into spring- i wouldn\\'t wear it in summer.  the fit is loose, i thought the medium arm holes were large for my frame- 5\\'8\" 140#.  overall i sent it back. This blouse is stunning on the website ;however, it is totally sheer which you cannot tell from the photo. i was very disappointed and will be returning. I really wanted to like this top. in person though, the fit was too large and boxy. i did order a smaller size based on other reviews but it was still too sacklike. i got the grey motif pattern which i thought was quite pretty and interesting. the material was nice and lightweight. perhaps it would look better on someone with a straight figure and small bust. This is quite large for akemi & kin i typically wear a medium but will be returning for a smaller size.print and flow of top are stunning. This coat is a beauty. the embroidery is much prettier irl and the wool is not itchy at all. best of all is the tailoring, as i am very petite and i am so tired of all the shapeless, sack-like coats/jackets. it fits tts and has pockets. it is perfect, just wish retailer has more offerings like this. I love this shirt but it was huge! i ordered a small and i was drowning in it. unfortunately i had to return it. This looks great on the model but when it arrived, i couldn\\'t believe it was the same jacket. it looks a bit like a really loose garbage bag on me and no amount of adjusting drawstrings is going to fix it. i really wanted to like it, but even the xs/s was too baggy. also a bit worried based on other reviews that it isn\\'t actually a rain jacket and wont keep you dry. There is no way this is worth the price. i was deeply disappointed when it arrived. the material is thin and feels cheap. i love the design, and anna sui, but this is just so overpriced. I thought the sweater itself was beautiful, but found the fabric to be stiff and itchy. Very cute and flattering but i\\'d order at least one size down. i\\'m usually a 25/26, and just during the time i tried on the 25s in the store, i could tell they\\'d loosen up enough for a 24. i\\'ll review more once i have them, had to order since they don\\'t typically have 24s in store, so can\\'t comment on quality as of yet. I like the tunic but there are no care instructions in the garment. if i wash it once and it shrinks or the dye runs it will be going back. please send care instructions. I loved this dress online and was luckily able to locate it in a store about an hour away from me. i drove to the store to purchase it; however, when i tried it on, i was so disappointed! the print is adorable and it is made of great quality, but the swing style is definitely more than mini! i could have fit 3 of myself in this dress. it is definitely not as depicted in the photographs. also, the background of the dress is way more pink than appears in the photos, and the floral print isn\\'t as r The blue has three colors of stripes: blue, white and black 9between white and blue). the black stripe made it too busy for me. the material is soft and clingy. i followed the advice of previous reviewer and sized up to a m (normally wear s). the shirt fit as pictured on the model, not tight but form fitting. Bought my 3rd pair of pilcro cords in the dark turquoise. the other 2 are from previous seasons. love these pants for fall because they are extremely comfortable and stylish. the dark turquoise was paired with the poppy tunic (in blue) at my local store. i liked the pairing and ended up buying both! i find these to fit true to size vs other items at retailer that fit larger. i am a 29 (8) while in most other pants at retailer, i am a 6. i am 5\\'7 and 135 lbs. Ordered this with my bday discount - the small felt a bit roomy so i took it to the store so i could possibly exchange for an xs. i literally could not even get my arm in the xs! tried a different small which was more fitted than the small i had received - so i would say the sizing can be inconsistent I ordered the taupe version of this tee, which was a medium brown with black stripes. the fabric felt itchy and rough, and was pretty sheer for not being light colored. i didn\\'t care for the fit, which was extremely boxy and wide; from the picture, i expected an a-line fit, but not a wide drop with webbed underarms. i ordered 2 sizes, and could have worn the smaller if i\\'d kept this tee. it runs on the larger side. what astounded me most was that both tees i ordered were sewn with completely cro I ordered this in both an extra small and a small... i found that there was a very big difference in the two sizes- the extra small was true to size and had a great width, but was shorter in length than i would\\'ve liked (if it shrunk at all, it would\\'ve been unwearable). the small was quite a jump in size and was a little wider than i liked, but i decided to keep that one. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe top was very cute and comfortable when i wore it, however i just washed it once on delicate in cold water and when i This suit did nothing for me. the top has zero support. this would work for a younger woman who does not require any support and is smaller chested. also, the top gapped in the center. it just did not fit right. the top is very thin showing everything. a light padding would make a big difference in this suit. also i could not get a good fit. as i tightened the top, the back would ride up. the bottoms are ok. not renatkable I saw this one for the first time today in-store and was not impressed. it is a lacey material with an under-layer, so with a different cut other than a swing dress i would have fallen in love and it would have been absolutely gorgeous. unfortunately, i did not like the swing dress cut, especially not in white. i wasn\\'t sure if the designer was going for a throw back to the 70s or a shortened version of my grandmother\\'s wedding gown, but either way it was not working for me. to be fair, swing dr Love these leggings!!! soft, cozy and yummy feeling! can\\'t wait for the weather to get cooler! these fleece-lined leggings will be a new staple this winter!!! I really didn\\'t expect this sweater to be so short. i\\'m 5\\'8\" and there is no way it would fit me properly. i honestly didn\\'t even try it on. i pulled it out of the bag and put it right back in and returned it. it looks like a crop top. i bought the blue, which was not as rich and nice looking in person as the picture. i love most things i buy through retailer but this was a swing and a miss. I was so so excited to get this sweater in the mail. unfortunately, the sweater is lined with the same material (very soft and warm btw) as the polka dots, which sheds like crazy. i wore a white tshirt under this for the first time, and my shirt was covered in black fuzz by the end of the day. so much so that i was gathering balls of it to be thrown away. very disappointed. a lint roller can\\'t even clean up the tshirt.\\n\\nin terms of sizing, this fits tts, i normally wear a l or xl, got this in an I\\'m happy the other reviewers made this dress work because it looked terrible on me. i\\'m 5,9\" and 128 lbs and it made me look like i had gained 25 lbs. as others have said, the pockets make the dress even worse-it\\'s very hard to get them to lay flat. the material is lovely, soft and i liked the gray color, but this dress made me feel like i was wearing something from an asylum. Great for lounging or running errands. can be dressed up or down. i found them to run at least a size large though. Ordered this top online, as i loved the colors and design, but i should have listened to the other reviewers. i ordered my usual size m, and it was just very unflattering. it was short and wide, not at all like it\\'s pictured on the model. needless to say it was immediately shipped back. I am 5 feet and 120 lbs. i ordered the honey. quality was excellent. no button issues. fits true to size. i ordered a small petite. my issue was the chino fabric was too casual. it\\'s okay. if it were on sale i would keep it, but not at full price. color is as shown in the honey. no issues on arm length. but i like mine a little longer. it\\'s kind of menswear. which some gals would like. i am a 34 c and it only looks good buttoned up on me. i\\'d say if your on the fence give it a try. it\\'s tts. I loved this top; it reminded me of one i have from retailer from circa 2008 in black and white; however, on this one, the chest area is too big, in both the 14 and 16, and i even found myself tugging downward on the fabric to keep it in place because the waist is elastic and also too big. i probably need a size 12, but then i fear it would be too short-waisted on me, for i am 5\\'10\". unfortunately, it is not for me. also, the sleeves are much bigger and flouncier than they appear in the photo on t I wanted to love this dress but sadly returned it.  i think it would be more appropriate for someone younger.  it runs very large but its not clingy so forgiving of anyone with chunkiness (such as myself).  i guess i just thought the blue was a little too unexciting (for me). I am 5\\'2 107lb and an xs petite.the embroidery was the only nice thing about this dress, but everything else was really unflattering -- the huge puffy sleeves especially. another reviewer said this was more like a shift, and she was right. not worth the price on sale. This dress has been on retailer\\'s site for a while now (years?) and i finally grabbed one during a recent member sale. i can\\'t believe i waited so long! it\\'s so gorgeous on - classy but still distinctly sexy. i\\'m 5\\'10\" 160# and the size 8 fits great - definitely fitted through the hips and thighs and roomy enough on top i considered taking it in. beautiful dress overall! I was really hoping to like this, but it did not look the way it does on the model, at least not on me. the sharkbite hem is much more pronounced and looser. the one in the photo looks like it was pinned back. i am 5\\'8\" and usually wear a medium or large. i got a medium and there was a lot more material on the bottom half than the photo shows. it made me look bigger and was not flattering. material has a nice weave but it\\'s thin and delicate. i bought the (holly) deep olive and the blue. colors I loved the fit and vibrant color of this dress. it\\'s loose and flows but doesn\\'t look like a potato sack. i wore it once and got a ton of compliments. that said, i hand washed it, as the tag states, then let it line dry, and it shrunk to half its size! i re-checked the tag and noticed that under the hand wash instructions it then states \"dry clean recommended.\" boo. so disappointed that i spend over $100 for a dress i wore once. The fit is really flattering and cute but the fabric and finishings seem really cheap. it\\'s a printed plaid - not woven. Like another reviewer mentioned, this shirt is way too short. i\\'m only 5\\'2\" (xs) and there is no way this top would tuck in like on the model. also, the quality isn\\'t great as it\\'s very thin and there are strings hanging from some of the seams in the front. it\\'s a shame b/c the print is really pretty and there is this cute little bicycle charm on the tag which makes it feel more unique. sadly, it\\'s going back! Love the crochet and and it is a great feel with a liner underneath that comes with the dress. a little boxy but another beautiful retailer dress overall :) I don\\'t know why i didn\\'t pay much attention to this tee (the yellow), but i didn\\'t. i saw it in the store, thought it was interesting and kept on going. then i really looked at it online and suddenly i had a bad case of the wants. so when i was in one of my local stores i asked about it, and no surprise, it was sold out. at the suggestion of my sales associate i tried on a solid one just for the size. although i\\'m small, i have several tla tees in medium, so i tried on a medium and a small. as The jacket is cute, it runs small but looks good. i like it even though it feels tight on my arms. When i spotted this online i just knew it was a \\'must have\\'. holding horses brand usually runs big on me, but this is a more fitted top. i ordered the size 4 & 6 so i cld compare. well, the 4 is a little snug in the bust area & the bodice seam falls high across the mid-bust area. except for that the fit is good. being cotton i realize it will probably shrink some when washed so i don\\'t think the 4 works for me. the size 6 is much looser overall & the fit is much better in the bust area. the armh Review title says almost all. add to that that it is age appropriate, unlike other kedia dresses, for the very young. just too cute for words. i have all of the other tk peasant dresses and although youthful they are appropriate for anyone young of heart. this however, on an older woman, looks ridiculous. i would have liked it for those 9 months but even then it would cover quadruplets! I love this sweater!!! it\\'s so fun and quirky and shakes up a regular sweater. a little large but it fits the style. First of all it arrived rolled in a tight ball the size of a large starbucks coffee. i don\\'t know why they do that.... you\\'re not going to be immediately impressed by something that is packaged like it\\'s cheap! second, i\\'m usually a 0-4 in retailer and mine is no where near as loose-fitting as the photo. also, he sleeves and back are a very thin waffle knit... like a flimsy t-shirt. and see-thru. the sleeves form-fit to my arms so i couldn\\'t layer under it, but i couldn\\'t wear it alone with the fa It\\'s amazing!\\r\\n\\r\\ni did size down on this one, but i didn\\'t have to. that depends on the kind of fit you are looking for. sizing down did make the shirt more form fitting in my chest area, but also did make the garment somewhat less comfortable in the armpit area for being tighter (but not too tight). my normal size would have alleviated this problem, but also would have left the shirt with not a whole lot of shape. i opted to have a little shape and deal with the fabric slightly digging into my The color says red but it\\'s more like a rust. i\\'m 5\\'3\" so it was long and would need to be tailored and the fabric is so thin i was afraid it would rip if it got caught on anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nfinally returned it without it making it out the door :( I was really excited to get this top in the mail; unlike other reviewers, i didn\\'t find that the top fit small, but i thought that the tight fit across the shoulders and chest didn\\'t look good with the billow-y torso of the top. i think this top would be flattering on really thin girls, but i\\'m very tall and broad shouldered, so it didn\\'t look as good on me. I purchased this sweater in a small . nothing on the web site states it has dolman sleeves! it looked sloppy and made my bust disappear! it went back i hate dolman sleeves. This dress is super bulky and unflattering. the knit is loose and see-through. looks like it was knitted by a five-year old. if you need a dress that adds twenty pounds then this is for you. back to the store it goes So disappointed! beautiful dress in the photographs but the cut was incredibly strange. loose and baggy through the top and mid-section but tight around the buttock and thighs. This is a beautiful vest. i love the color-blocking, the modern and structured style, and its versatility.  i bought it with a defective item discount because there were some stains. i promptly took it to the dry cleaners and was informed that the black would bleed onto the white paneling if they did a full wash. they spot-cleaned it, and it did bleed. although the tag says to dry clean this baby, the black dye will bleed to the white fabric. i\\'ll be taking it back into the store today for a ref These pants are so flattering, comfortable, and silky smooth. a versatile fall staple for sure. i bought my usual 28 and they fit perfectly. It is a beautiful dress,but didn\\'t fit me.this is better for someone tall and thin. The jeans look so different online! the pair i got did not have the stone washed look and was completely different cut. the rise is not as stated and is actually 10.5 inches! also, i\\'m a true 25 and the waist is like a 27, but the legs are super skinny. i\\'m so disappointed and i\\'m not even sure if is worth swapping out for a smaller size. these look more like men\\'s cut jeans. I love these jeans! another winner in the pilcro line. i took a size 29. i normally wear a 30/31 depending on cut. i am 5\\'4 inches and about 150 lbs curvy with small waist and the 29 fits comfortably and very flattering to my figure. love the button front and the red details . i recall having jeans like these about 15 years ago and this cut is so perfect , cute and stylish. the regular length hit just slighting above the center of my foot so wearing with flats will be perfect, i am not a high he Got this in the sky color. returned it because the top is way too sheer for me, if you know what i mean. i wanted a pretty gown i can wear without a robe in front of my kids. no can do. also, for the price, material just felt flimsy & cheap. it does run small ~ the medium was good on me and i\\'m 5\\'2\", 114#, 34b I was afraid it would be too poufy but it isn\\'t at all. i\\'d say it runs a bit large. i usually wear a 6 or 8 and the 6 fits perfectly. Even following the care label exactly, it shrunk ~3 inches in the length and overall in the diameter. i had to return this since i am tall and it looked more like a work-inappropriate mini after the first wash. I recommend this dress because it is beautiful, stylish and well made even though it did not work for me. i tried the small and extra small. the first - way too big, lengthwise (hit my knees) as well as in the shoulders - the latter to tight across the chest - not for me but worth a try. i am typically a small with usually never have a problem with length. This is a cute top and i did not even need my usual petite size thanks to the 3/4 length sleeves. i liked the semi-abstract sailboat pattern and the style is comfortable to wear. however, the tie at the neckline didn\\'t appeal to me so ultimately i did not buy it. The front and back materials differ. the back of the shirt is soft and thin. the front embroidery is stiff but i imagine it will soften after a wash. pretty shirt though. Very disappointed the back of this blouse is plain, not as displayed. I\\'ve been looking for the perfect white eyelet maxi, feels like a perfect summer staple...but sadly this was not it. quality isn\\'t great which is surprise on a $168 price tag. top of dress is lined but cheaply so it\\'s somewhat see through. the dress was returned. The material used is soft and breezy and good for summer.the design is unique and catchy. the two cons its dry clean and runs very large. i normally wear m from retailer and this top in \"s\" still too roomy. since its for summer, i\\'m keeping it as it is. I generally don\\'t write bad reviews, but there is a real discrepancy between the quality of this kimono and the cost. the design and colors are great, but the fabric is ripping on all the kimonos on the rack in my store where the manufacturer\\'s tag is at the back of the neck. the material is very thin, so there are other small holes beginning throughout the garment. i shop at retailer all the time, and this is not a $98 item of clothing. This top has nice quality lace but the layout is strange! it wouldn\\'t stay under my boobs but kept creeping up and looked strange! not for girls with a chest! This colors and fabric of this dress are beautiful and i really wanted to love it but from the chest to the hips there is too much fabric and it give you no shape at all. it had to go back. This looked fabulous on the model, of course, and i love sweater dresses. but even in an xs, i was drowning in fabric and looked ludicrous. concept is good but execution went terribly wrong somewhere. a definite return. This is really cute sweater, soft, cozy. around the chest bit small went up size but the shape looked the same. i\\'m keep it because of softness, warmth and versatile. i got it in black. would recommend it, or at least try it for yourself. I tried the red version at store, it fit really good and i loved it. then i found the blue version online and liked even more. it can be worn for business and casual. I usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops, ordered this top in an s and it was so wide on the sides and huge it fit like a tent.  not even remotely flattering.  i thought about ordering it in an xs, however, i could tell the xs was still going to have way too much fabric.  back it goes. The details on this dress were pretty, but it was super poofy and i felt like it made me look bigger than i am. maybe if you have a straight body and want to create curves this would work for that, but not great on an hourglass/pear shaped figure. fits tts. I have a hard time with sizes here. i literally can wear sm-large depending on the brand, so it\\'s hard to buy online. i was worried this would be too short as i\\'m 5\\'9\\' so i got a large and it\\'s a little too bulky. i will be heading to the store to exchange and hope they have a green one left :) The dress is not like pictured. it is above the knee and sleeves are neither 3/4 nor full length-somewhere in between. i am 5\\'4, 112 lbs, bought xs regular. had higher expectations for the price. going back to the store. This is a cute work jacket, as well as paired with jeans.  flattering. very soft.  only con is this is thick with a soft cotton lining, so not great for summer in az, but will get plenty of use this fall. typically 6-8 on the top, i went with medium.  not tight in the arms as other reviewer noted. I was really hoping this dress would work out, as it looks like it could be a staple outfit for work! the material is very nice, but unfortunately the dress was way too big. there is a band right under the chest that i would think should be somewhat fitted to give the dress some shape to your figure, but it was wayyy to big on me (especially considering i am large-chested! i will be returning this. This is such a cool military jacket. when i saw it displayed on a table at my local retailer, i knew it was going home with me. this is my 4th marrakech jacket, i love their style. i bought the black in my usual size large, and i agree with the previous reviewer, if you have a chest this is a very flattering jacket. i usually wear my jackets open, and i discovered that if you button back the lapels at the second button down it looks amazing and not so sloppy. it kind of bothered me the way Did not work for me. whatsoever. the stripes were adorable but the piece just didn\\'t fit like on the model. the collar was practically choking me and the tie just didn\\'t make my figure look the way it normally does. aka i looked frumpy and chunky, which i\\'m not. going back. Did not work for me. whatsoever. the stripes were adorable but the piece just didn\\'t fit like on the model. the collar was practically choking me and the tie just didn\\'t make my figure look the way it normally does. aka i looked frumpy and chunky, which i\\'m not. going back. The straight-leg silhouette is ruined for me by the immediate bulge beneath the elastic waistband, mostly caused by the pockets. their openings protrude out right below the waistband. it\\'s not flattering and while the trousers are not too tight for my hips, they give the impression of extra hips. if not for that silhouette issue, i would keep the trousers, as they are comfortable and pretty, and unlike my other trouser options. not see-through, as i feared. Like the other reviewer said, the print is more beautiful in person. i am usually a small in meadow rue, and this fits well in a small. my only issue is that the lining hangs out from the bottom, and hangs out unevenly! hopefully i can exchange it or get it sewed up evenly. This dress you will want to try on in the store. it is very thick and stiff fabric. the whole front is embroidered and the big drawback for me is that waist seam. there is absolutely no give in that waist. this is not stretchy fabric and not easy for just any body type to wear. sad because it is very pretty on the rack! I own two poodles and love anything poodle print. i was estatic to see this and i snagged it on sale. but it is horrible. the fit is like wearing a pillowcase. it was about 5 inches too wide on each side while the arms fit. it looked like it was attempting to have a dolman shape but it was way too short, wide, and wrong. i was in love with the print however i had to return it. It\\'s pretty, floaty, feminine; the photos don\\'t do justice to the prettiness. but the photos also don\\'t show an asymmetrical hem. i understood it runs small so i got two sizes, to be safe, and even my larger size was strangely short-waisted, and i\\'m short-waisted to start with. maybe i could\\'ve lived with that, but both the dresses i received have an uneven hem unlike any i\\'ve ever worn or seen before. it\\'s not longer on just the sides; the hem is longer in one spot on the front, and one in the The good: the sloths are cute because sloths are always cute. \\r\\n\\r\\nnow the bad: the material is wretched. it feels damp even when it\\'s not... it\\'s see through and unlined... it\\'s scratchy and wrinkly... and though the cut of the dress would be fine, the fabric is so limp that the high-low hem looks more like a tail. \\r\\n\\r\\ni wanted to like this, but charging nearly 200 dollars for a see through piece of awful fabric with a passable cut was simple not acceptable. i returned it as fast as i possibly c I had tried this on in the beige & loved it but could not find it in my size so i got it in the pink.\\r\\ndid not look at good as the beige. Gals, if you absolutely must have this top wait for it to go on sale (don\\'t worry, it will). between the poor fit and the polyester, i have no good things to report about it. this is very much below retailer\\'s usual quality and style. So i actually loved this skirt (the tea rose color and coppery gold buttons were perfect together) and it\\'s rare to find something that\\'s simultaneously so form-fitting and comfortable.... but i hold a lot of my weight in my butt and thighs, and i just felt like it was a little too sexy for work (especially with that long slit - i might feel differently if it didn\\'t have that slit, because then i could at least pair it with a cute oversized cardigan to tone things down a bit for the office). if If you care that it\\'s sheer- be forewarned. i probably won\\'t wear a cami under it, as it\\'s not terrible, but worth noting. that said, its lightweight fabric will be perfect for summer and its design is gorgeous boho at its best. it\\'s cut quite generously and i do wish i\\'d gone down a size. This is baby soft and a great basic. i ordered my normal size large and it clings in an unattractive way so you might want to size up for a better fit if you\\'re not going to wear it as a layer. the black color is saturated in a good way. it\\'s also very long but i\\'m short so this would be perfect for taller frames. Well, i wanted to love it and it was just too much. i think it is a bit wider and weirdly baggier than it should be. i also feel it should be fully lined. it was not. the exterior wool and pattern is very nice. maybe if it was lined, a smaller size would have worked better, but for the price, i needed more. i also would have liked some sort of option for tightening the waist a bit when zipped up. i realize this isn\\'t in the picture, so no expectation, but upon trying it on and seeing its boxines I wanted to love this shirt. i like the style, the material is soft but it was so short on me. perhaps i just have a long torso but it fit everywhere else. i wasn\\'t even able to tuck it in because the sides just were so short. I recently bought this dress and wore it once. i really liked it! it was comfy, cute and fit well. but... then i washed it. i followed the washing instructions exactly, but now it looks more like a shirt than a dress and it\\'s completely unwearable. i\\'m super disappointed because i thought this dress would be a wardrobe staple this summer. These pants are more like 9\" not 10\". i was very dissappointed. the color is great and so is the fabric.\\r\\nif you look more closely at the model the pants don\\'t fit her either!! they are too small! i haven\\'t decided whether or not to take them back because i am losing weight. i am a 31 so far but these pants are like a 30. i need the color because they go perfectly with a top i bought from retailer Omg - i laughed so hard after i put these on. i was so excited to get them. i ordered them in my usual 4. i got a little suspicious when i pulled them out and noticed they had an elastic waist band.\\n\\nthey were a little too small for me and even if they were not it\\'s hard to imagine a world in which they didn\\'t make me look like an oompa loompa or a hobbit! they are beautifully made and i kept looking at the picture and wondering why they don\\'t look like that on me? i definitely have a curvier sh Being six feet tall, i\\'m always combing reviews for the opinions of other tall women, and i\\'m glad i did on this one! with the off the shoulder look, you can sometimes gain extra length, and it\\'s true in this case. i stayed tts because of length issues, and while it is billowy, it\\'s not horribly so. i would think, however, if you\\'re between sizes, or not worried about height, i\\'d go with the smaller option. adorable, comfy, casual while being dressy enough for a night out! I wanted to like this dress, but it just did not work for a bustier frame. the fabric is quite loose, does not nip in at the waist and is not particularly clingy, so if you are well-endowed, your assets create a bit of a shelf from which the rest of the dress just hangs. as a result, the swing comes from the apex of your chest as opposed to from your hips (as on the model), and the asymmetrical hemline makes the look even more awkward. on smaller curves, this would likely be very flattering, but This top is really cute and i love the design. however, the first time i wore it, the waste band started unraveling. Totally see through. Tried in store today and found to fit tts. images are accurate in terms of color and showing that there is a tiny bit of sheerness to this (as you can see near the bottom in each photo). i really loved everything about it except that it flared out a bit on the bottom in a way that i\\'d probably fuss with too much. id probably buy it on sale, but not before that. This is one of those dresses that hides on the rack until you see it. and you think, hmmm- this is really interesting. and then you try it on. and all the ladies in the dressing room say \"whoa\" yep, this is that dress. much more fitted and flattering on my 5\\'9\" 150lb frame. it oddly kind of alludes to 70\\'s caftans. very cool. Hate i have to return it - way too long-almost more mid thigh/almost dress length. I just bought this dress today, and it is absolutely stunning. it looks so much better in person than on the model. i think it runs true to size, however it does have relaxed fit. overall, the dress has nice quality fabric and nice flow, without adding bulk. great buy! I can\\'t believe how small these are. i almost wondered if the size was marked incorrectly. these are so pretty and such a shame because i love them. the rise in the crotch is also very short. very full in the legs and one is longer than the other:( the stripes don\\'t line up in places which is also disappointing for this price! Very flattering on. i\\'m 5\\'4\" /145lbs and took a small. i love how substantial the fabric is and how slimming it looks on. the only weird thing for me is getting it on?you had to step thru the opening on top, there are no zippers, buttons and if you have larger hips or butt, it will be a challenge to get on. once on, it looks great and believe it or not, roomy. I was excited to see this top, ordered it and was disappointed. it was too tight across the chest and had too much fabric around the bottom. i tried this on 3 times hoping for i had been wrong in previous assessments- no luck. After reading the other reviews, i had to write my own. i think this dress is adorable. it is a tunic and advertised as such. i think the drawcord and the way it is styled is really different and gives the dress some pop. i am 5\\'4\" so the length is good for me. i didn\\'t have trouble with the arms as some did. the slip was a problem , too small, especially considering the dress is a tunic and fits as a tunic. the dress fits me as it does the model. with a pair of cute boots, this dress rocks. This tunic was a surprise - the navy color and the knit material and the colorful designs on the front just accentuates the tunic. however, i agree with the previous reviewer about the high slits and it\\'s pretty wide, better if it was a 1/4 or 1/2 inch less. fits tight on the arms and shoulders but a bit loose below the bodice.\\n\\ni cut the tags to wear it and found out that part of the embroidery on one of the designs had unraveled!\\nsadly returning. I love the desi blouse! i got it in white and it\\'s a little more off white than pure white, but it is a great flowy top. the touch of lace across the bust is a nice accent. the only down fall is that the sleeves are a bit puffy, but the rest of the top makes up for that. I didn\\'t mind the \"scratchiness\" others proclaimed this garment had, but it is made very tight in the arms and across the back. looks great from the front, but uncomfortable. This is a very pretty top with nice lace details. the linen makes it not quite as soft as 100% cotton but still comfortable and breathable. the fit was just right in the small petite. i tried it on in the store and was very tempted, but wound up not buying it because i have other similar tops. i would snap it up if it went on sale or if i needed a top of this type. Read the reviews and thought i would just remove the label asap to prevent snags since i loved the item! \\r\\nhowever, the item came with unrepairable holes, not just snags and they are either on the neck or front sleeve which forces me to return the item asap. didn\\'t even try it on. so sad, but i still love retailer!!! I see all the amazing reviews and on one hand, i agree with them. but these pants do run huge and they don\\'t fit tailored like on the model. on me, they fit loose around the legs and thighs and they\\'re super wrinkly. you\\'ll have to iron these after every wear and every wash. i\\'m surprised to see the comment saying they\\'re wrinkle resistant. they aren\\'t. also, the kahki is more grey which i don\\'t love. i got these on sale, but even at $50 i just can\\'t justify keeping them. they\\'re super comfy but I have been continually disappointed in retailer\\'s clothing for the past year. i feel like their prices have soared and the quality has remained so-so, but dresses like these somehow make the cut. it does not make sense. since when did retailer exclusively market to older women? no, retailer\\'s market has always been young adults. this dress is extremely matronly. although the bottom print is nice, the hot pink belt?? is completely mismatched and gaudy. i really hope retailer starts curating better dress I ordered this in my usual retailer size, xspetite and it was too baggy in the bust. granted, i\\'m only a 34aa, but i would still expect it to be a little smaller in the bust at that size. the elastic waist was a little loose too (i have a 26\" waist, 34\" hips) and the inner slip showed a tiny bit like another reviewer said but it\\'s the same fabric as the dress. the slip is adjustable but it\\'s attached to the dress at the waist. it wasn\\'t flattering on me in the hips either. this was a miss for me b This top is too short, so much so that tucking it in would be difficult. the designs are lovely, but the short length is putting this top back on the rack. My conscience screamed at me not to buy this sweater and i wish i had listened! i noted the fact that it was acrylic and also the fact that it was oversized. but i also loved the design and can\\'t resist anything with mustard yellow. i was instantly disappointed when i received it, almost didn\\'t even try it on. how can they possibly charge $185 for terrible itchy 80\\'s acrylic? it looks cheap, it feels cheap and it didn\\'t even fit well. only redeeming quality: easily returnable! Loved the look, quality was great, but didn\\'t work for me. too busy and off-fitting. i did return. I was hesitant to try this on because honestly, it looked so short. however, i just bought this at my retailer store and it is very flattering on! 1st of all, it runs big. my normal size (12) was way too big and i had to go down a size. i could have gone down 2 sizes but the length became problematic. in my regular size (that was too big), the skirt hit me a few inches above my knee. perfect! in the size smaller, it was a tad higher; wish it was the same longer length as the 12 but still acceptabl Ordered this in white and the peachy color- the armholes were gaping. not well designed. i don\\'t recommend this tee at all. This top was very cute but super short- and i am a short waisted petitie person-the waistline hits above your belly button- looks very silly. As the other reviewer said, the skirt had this weird bunching on both sides of the hips-it was ridiculous. i don\\'t know how anyone could wear it-looks like you had two little triangle things poking out from each hip. i\\'m long and lean so usually skirts like this fit me well. very very strangely constructed-i couldn\\'t keep it even at the deeply discounted price The appliquã© on this dress is well done. i would recommend it to anyone. the design is super flattering and feminine. I love the look and the simplicity of this top! it\\'s very casual, but also super cute. my only issue with it was the fabric started to ball up after a few wears. but i still love it! I lived the front and back designs but didn\\'t like the fit. No complaints about this top. i like that it\\'s very soft and the length is good as a tunic. would recommend. This tee is so cute and well constructed. it\\'s not a fabric that\\'s going to wrinkle and pill eventually which i love. it runs tts and i like that it\\'s thin but not to sheer that i need a camisole - just a nude bra! This is a true tiny top........gorgeous and runs small. i usually wear a small or medium in retailer tops, but timy i always size up. i\\'m a 36c, and a large fits perfect. the front is a bit sheer, but not so much you need a cami. I thought these were great everyday shirts for the price. i got them on sale over christmas. they fit well and i really love the striped shirt. the navy is an odd color and looks strange with jeans but i love the top regardless 3 tags sewn in, 2 small (about 1\\'\\' long) and 1 huge (about 2\\'\\' x 3\\'\\'). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however, this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn\\'t so itchy! I was able to get this on sale. when it arrived, it was missing half of the rhinestones. i am very surprised that this top would be sent out this way. it also was missing the little bag with extra stones. i\\'m reaching out and wondering if anyone else has experienced this and is there a store that sells rhinestones like the one on the blouse? any help from anyone would be appreciated. i hate to part with this, but where was quality control? It\\'s pretty, floaty, feminine; the photos don\\'t do justice to the prettiness. but the photos also don\\'t show an asymmetrical hem. i understood it runs small so i got two sizes, to be safe, and even my larger size was strangely short-waisted, and i\\'m short-waisted to start with. maybe i could\\'ve lived with that, but both the dresses i received have an uneven hem unlike any i\\'ve ever worn or seen before. it\\'s not longer on just the sides; the hem is longer in one spot on the front, and one in the After reading the other reviews i still took a chance on ordering this dress becasue it looks so cute on the model. the dress they sent me is not this dress. it is the same material although the one i received had only one stripe down the canter, like a cross. there was no v back as stated by the other reviewer. it was scoop and if you pulled it down, the neck went up. the dress i received is branded as holding horses while the brand listed on here, is rava. the length measured at 39\" not the st There may be no inner lining, but it is a gorgeous bra! and so comfortable! the straps and well make and sturdy and the detailing is stunning. it is absolutely true to size. 34c fit like a glove. a winner! The material of the dress is gorgeous, but the armholes droop much too low under the arms. in addition, i am fairly broad shouldered and the cut across the chest is too narrow, exposing your \"chicken wings\" in an unflattering way. this is gorgeous on the model, so i would say narrow shouldered girls should order a size down and give it a shot! The design and style of shirt is quite cute -- but the mountain pictures is not mont blanc, nor does the mountain find itself near chamomix.\\nit is an unmistakable image of the matterhorn and the small town of zermatt is at its base. I received this top in the mail today not what i expected at all! it is a great fabric just way too much of it. it is proportionally incorrect width wise. unfortunately this one will be going back. This would have been a perfect jacket for a trip i\\'m taking, light weight and very stylish. however the jacket runs huge, the arms are long but it was the shoulders that were too big. i wear a size 8-10 mostly 10 in retailer clothes i ordered the large and the shoulder seam was about 2? past my natural shoulders. i won\\'t return for a smaller size because the fabric being wool (i should have checked) its unbearably itchy esp around the neck, you could wear a long sleeve top and a scarf but then it I am so glad i read the reviews for this before i purchased it. i am 5\\'5 and 135 pounds and normally wear a size 6 in dresses. i would normally buy a small, but sized down to an xs and it was perfect! it\\'s a beautiful dress and very flattering! I can\\'t believe how small these are. i almost wondered if the size was marked incorrectly. these are so pretty and such a shame because i love them. the rise in the crotch is also very short. very full in the legs and one is longer than the other:( the stripes don\\'t line up in places which is also disappointing for this price! These pants are so comfy, well-fitting and flattering. i will order the same style in more colors and patterns because i can tell this will be my uniform this summer. true to size if you like a close fit like i do. size up if you like a loose fit. length is shorter than capri--more like a 1950s pedal pusher. cute. This lacey dress fits well and is very comfortable. I live in ny and bought his coat for the winter, thinking since it was made out of wool it would be warm. this coat is extremely thing, more like a spring/fall coat and therefore i don\\'t think the price justifies the quality. i am going to return and consider repurchasing if it goes on sale. i also wish it had a button or way of keeping it closed rather than just hang loosely. I wanted to love this top, but had 2 major problems with it. first, it\\'s not for short girls. i\\'m only 5\\' tall and it was a total mess on me proportion wise. the sleeves were way too long and the seam where the sweater and peplum meet hit right in the middle of my butt, which was terribly unflattering. second, the grey fabric was very thin and kinda cheap looking. no regrets on returning this one. I purchased this top in the store, intending only to go in and return two tops i purchased on sale that did not fit. i had been looking for a red top to wear with navy, and this one couldn\\'t have looked more perfect on the hanger. from the front, it looks pretty traditional, but the back is just gorgeous! the multi-colors and the pleating give the top a lot of interest and depth. the fabric is also super soft and comfortable. the top does run quite large, though, as i purchased an xs and still h I saw this in the store and was glad i didn\\'t order it earlier online. i thought it would be beautifully stitched but it was rather flat and unimpressive in person. i like more unusual and flattering pieces, and this just wasn\\'t it. no compliments here. I hate to be so negative but i can\\'t believe this shirt has so many positive reviews. it is stiff, silver lace and hangs funny if you have a chest. adding a cami undnerneath makes it worse. looks cheap. Loved this blouse when i received it after ordering online! the cut and style of the blouse is so cute and looks great with jeans. it is well made but it is see-through so i had to wear something under it. otherwise, really flattering, unique design! Love this swimsuit. runs true to size. definitely recommend. very flattering. for reference i have a straight/athletic build, i\\'m 5\\'11\", 150, 34c, and size 8 was great for top and bottom. I love jumpsuits in general. however, it is usually either a yay or a nay and this was definitely a yay! i am currently wearing it right now as i write this review! the waistband hits perfectly on me. i am 5\\'7 and about 160 and i bought the large. super easy to throw on! I love the look of this dress but it runs very large. i am 5\\'2 110lbs. i ordered the extra small on sale & got a killer deal on it. i intended to use it as a beach cover up since it\\'s sheer, but when i tried it on i felt like i was wearing a mumu. even for the price & for the beach i am going to return it. i\\'m sad because it is a beautiful cover-up and for what it is i think the quality is good. I knew i needed to buy this trench from the moment i saw it on my computer screen, but something prompted me to stop by my local retailer and try it on first. thank goodness for that.\\r\\n\\r\\nat first glance, i knew i wouldn\\'t be buying this. the construction leaves much to be desired. from the flimsy, single layer of unlined, unstructured fabric, to the thin strip of fabric serving as a belt, i could easily see this being sold at a cheap store for teenage girls where throwaway clothes are a dim I tried this on in the store and it was huge. i couldn\\'t try on a smaller size because they only had a 2 and 4. i tried on my usual size 12. i don\\'t think the embroidery is as pretty in person either. definitely not worth the price. This looks cute in the web photo, unfortunately it is absolutely huge in person. i got the small and have to return it because it is not wearable for me. Much to my surprise when i tried on this sweater i found that it was cut in a bell shape and not at all fitted or straight like in the photo. when i pulled it out of the package i thought i\\'d ordered the wrong size because the shoulders looked so narrow. but when i tried it on the shoulders fit perfectly, with beautiful detail and high quality material, but the sweater belling out to a very wide shape. it is very wide at the hip and looks out of proportion. it doesn\\'t look anything like the phot I wanted to love this dress. the cut, fit and color are adorable. unfortunately the fabric is super thin. due to the material type it can be clingy in a manner that requires the anti-static spray your mom used to use in the 80s. i was on the fence of keeping it, but if there is so much as a wrinkle in your panty-line the whole world will see it. i would hate to have to wear a slip with this due to static issue. i am most likely going to return it; even at 15% off, it is over-priced for the cheap The image does not show but the front of the dress has a heavy 24\" utility zipper hidden with 5 snaps. the zipper pull, when closed, sat right on my collarbone, which was he height of discomfort. it felt heavy and awkward. the dress was very high waisted for me (i\\'m 5\\'6\" and it was 3\" inches above the navel)) also to the point of discomfort.\\n\\nan invisible side zipper would have made the difference for me if the proportions were better suited for a non-petite sizing.\\n\\nthe fabric is quite beautifu After readying the reviews of this dress, i thought for sure i was purchasing a winner. boy, was i wrong! first, this dress feels like a potato sack and looked like one on. i felt that it was very boxy and more of a o\\' one size fits all\\' sizing. it did not embrace my curves at all. the material was not as chic as i would have thought. overall, the entire dress was not flattering. honestly, i do not understand what the rave reviews were talking about it. I love these pants but be care when you do laundry. the dye transferred to another pair of pilcro chinos that was a little lighter color. very frustrating. label mentioned it but i only noticed after it happened because the colors are both not that dark at all. I was definitely wearing retailer colored glasses (my term for when something looks great on you in the dressing room but leaves you wondering what-was-i-thinking when you try it on later) when i bought this. once i tried this on at home, i basically felt like i was swallowed up by this thing -- there\\'s so much fabric layered in front and around your shoulders that you can actually feel the weight hanging down around your neck, and it naturally sticks out rather far in the back. i wanted to love t So small! i was a solid size 12 in skirts but recently lost some weight. i was still nervous to buy a size 10 so i bought the 12 thinking i can always take it in if i have to. the 12 - which should have been big on me was tiny. this skirt is built for someone with non-existent hips. returning. If you are like me and your shoulders are broader than your hips, the boat-neck on this won\\'t be too wide on you.\\n----------\\ni am normally a m or l in retailer tops, and went with the m, and i have very large biceps. if you\\'re broad-shouldered but have smaller arms, i would recommended sizing down a size.\\n----------\\ni have a very long torso and didn\\'t find this to be too short...but i love jeans with a 10\" rise. if you are going to pair this with low or medium (8.5\") rise jeans, then yes, you will I love these. i like that they\\'re fancier than your basic summer shorts but they still look casual and effortless. unlike the other reviews i found that they run large. i\\'m usually a 4, maybe a 6, and the 4 is roomy.  still looks good though just rides a bit lower on my hips. The sweater runs large, the sweater is designed in such a way that it looks very sloppy. i would never be able to wear it out of the house. however, the material is exceptionally soft and delightful. keeping as its a great stay at home & lounge sweater, but way over priced for this purpose. if you can get the fabric to lay correctly, you\\'re a genius. This dress was very boxy and unflattering. i really wanted to like it because the blue and white details were so pretty but it had to go back. I love love love these white jeans. the crop style is great as i am 5\\'1\", so the fit is perfect for an ankle jean.\\r\\nthese fit the bill in every way. they are so comfy! Saw this online when it first came up and thought it looked lovely. i purchased a different pleated dress and decided i didn\\'t need a second pleated dress. was at my local retailer and they had one pink dress in a size 4 and a blue in a 0. decided to try them both on. the zero actually fit perfectly and at the sale price i had to have it. the material is beautiful, little details like the ruffled hem are lovely. one i will wear for years. thinking about getting the link but the blue is lovely. i\\'m I tried this on at my local retailer store in the white. the fabric is pretty with metallic threads of silver running through the white. the white is see-through but that didn\\'t bother me as i would wear it as a beach cover-up. i would say it runs large. i am usually a size small (4-6) and the xs was quite roomy on me (and i\\'m 5\\' 9\" tall), 32d chest. i liked it, it was comfortable, but i just couldn\\'t decide if i looked a bit frumpy in it. maybe it was just too big all over. in the end, i d I loved the lines in this jacket, but ended up returning it because they didn\\'t show up how i expected. the jacket had a surprisingly baggy fit (s on my usual s/4/6) and wasn\\'t quite what i was looking for. Nice fabric, great color, would be lovely ... on someone with a straight-and-narrow body type. for ladies with curves, take a pass--too much like maternity wear, and not in that elegantly slouchy kind of way. the straight-up \"is she or isn\\'t she\" kind of way. The colors are vivid and perfectly autumnal but the fit is a mess. it was overall too large, the waistline curves up in the front and then falls into small pleats which was maternityish, the waistband was thicker than the dress and sat away from my body and the material was a cheapish poly. had the outer dress been made from the same material as the lining, i would have liked it better. the modesty closure was a plus but the dress was already unraveling when i took it out. #returned For reference, i\\'m 113 lbs, with a short torso so i was thrilled when i saw this jacket on-line. i was expecting a soft, comfortable and polished piece. i tried on a standard size xs and the color of the khaki is muted on line, it\\'s a little darker in person and the finishings like zipper plackets are much lighter in contrast. also, it is a \"mixed-media/material\" type. for example, it\\'s linen with soft leather accents, which also have varying tones on the inside of the collar, on the wrist area, When i saw this online i immediately put it on my \"must buy\" list. i hate paying the exorbitant shipping fees retailer charges so i was waiting until i could get to my local store, in the meantime it looks like it has sold out online but i am sure it will be back in stock soon. luckily, my b&m store had it and i am so glad i didn\\'t waste my money or time ordering it online. this could have been great but once again antho missed the mark. what the product shot online doesn\\'t show is that it has dol I have quite a few of these tiny henleys because they are unique and comfortable. the color and details of this one are beautiful. if you are a fan of these too, you won\\'t be disappointed with this one. I know this product description says oversized but that\\'s an understatement. i ordered a small and tried it on and i looked like a little kid in their father\\'s jacket. i don\\'t even think an xs would have worked. i\\'m 5\\'6\" and about 135 pounds for reference. i will say that the embroidery on the back is very cool and this jacket is overall a cool concept but it\\'s just way too big. After reading every review, i was certain i knew exactly what i was getting with this dress. wrong. i sized up from a small to a medium and the dress was still uncomfortably tight on my rib cage. the top is very exposing of the bust, and i\\'m small busted. i can\\'t stand wearing camis, so there no way i\\'d be able to wear this dress even if i sized up again to a large. for reference, i\\'m 5\\'6\", a straight build 134 lbs, and wear a 6. pluses on this dress are, i loved the green color and length of sk This is my third byron lars and as usual it is absolutely gorgeous and so worth the price. it completely flatters the body and all the details add so much interest, creating a very unique dress. The button detail on the sides is a unique design detail. i had fun playing with different looks that came with unbuttoning and buttoning the sides. but i decided against purchasing this top, it appeared shapeless on me. i have a curvier/athletic figure, and a straight up and down cut is not flattering on my figure. Not what i expected. they ran very small and the fabric seemed cheap for the price. returned. This dress looks better in person. the shape is pretty much straight, but fits nicely even if you are curvier. it doesn\\'t show your imperfections. the type blue and white color is nice, but a bit see through on the bottom and the slip is a little short. came to about mid thigh for me so i would wear leggings underneath. i don\\'t think a belt would look good with this because of the shape and if you have curves. very cool summer style. I so wanted to love this top. i ordered the \"blue\", which is blue and orange. i thought the orange would be brighter, it is not. it is a dull color. also, i\\'m usually a medium, this top fits fine on my shoulders/bust 34c, but it was huge around the waist, making me look a lot larger. if this top were a bit smaller around the waist, i would keep it, but it is going back. I love, love, love this skirt. it\\'s comfortable and attention getting. i receive compliments whenever i wear it -- and i feel great wearing it. colors are much more vivid than on the website -- that\\'s a plus! I was able to get this on sale. when it arrived, it was missing half of the rhinestones. i am very surprised that this top would be sent out this way. it also was missing the little bag with extra stones. i\\'m reaching out and wondering if anyone else has experienced this and is there a store that sells rhinestones like the one on the blouse? any help from anyone would be appreciated. i hate to part with this, but where was quality control? I wanted to love this tunic sweater. the material is so soft and a perfect weight. the color is pretty. bu the fit absolutely did not work for me. the tunic runs very small. a large usually fits me but i felt like i was wearing a small. the slits are quite high. i was sorry to do it but this one went straight back! I was so excited to try this sweater on when it arrived but to my disappointment, it was overly large! i was pratically swimming in it. really love the design and the way it looks on the model. just didn\\'t work out that way on me. This dress really was huge, and not at all flattering. i don\\'t know how they got it to look good on the model in the picture. material was nice and soft, but i really don\\'t see how anyone could look good in this, no matter what your body shape is. I received tons of compliments on this adorable jumper and felt like i was wearing comfy pajamas. i wore it to a baby shower and it was a hit. i\\'m 5\\'4\" and it was a bit long and needed to be hemmed, otherwise it\\'s perfect! I was excited to receive this top and wanted to love it; however, the side ruffles flared out more than i expected. it didn\\'t look right on me so had to return it :( As a long standing retailer shopper, i have seen the beginnings of retailer great quality and detail and somewhat over the years disappointed of quality going down; this vest is so my style and executed very well as being fully lined and sewn well, hooks to close are substantial; the fact the faux fur collar can be removed is a real plus, but though the colors are delish, the fabric is a bit questionable.  the one i ordered on line and sent to me is fresh and not petted, but looking at the same vest I bought both colors based on the reviews and really like the prints. however, they are too sheer. i don\\'t want to wear a tank top, but you have to with these tops since they are so sheer. i can also see the fabric tearing easily, it is too delicate. i sent both colors back. what a waste because the prints and colors are good. these tops are also not for busty ladies. i have a big bust, and the top part didn\\'t cover my entire bust and was awkward because the division between the fabrics would st Looks great on the model, but in actuality there is way too much fabric; what should be flowy and billowy looks like a tent (or a maternity top on a petite woman). it didn\\'t matter which size, they all fit me disastrously. i love the look and i thought of keeping it and having it taken in, but there\\'s too much fabric under the chest to make it an easy cut/alteration on the side seams. sometimes i wonder who comes up with these patterns, and if they pin the shirts back on the models. if you put a Beautifully made shirt however the sizing is way off. the sleeves and across the chest are really tight while the rest of the shirt fits fine. if you get a size larger then the shirt in the body is to large. would recommend if you have really tiny shoulders, arms and chest. such a shame since i really love the shirt. If i stopped eating for a couple of months or jumped into a time machine and set the dial for 1990 i would really enjoy this beautifully made delicate blouse. the problem area is evident looking at the photo --the tiny tight fitted gorgeous bodice. i will keep this piece becasue i love it so and the apocolypse is apparently imminent and i have hardly any food in the house. I tried this on as it was on sale and my size was on the store. i didn\\'t end up buying it as it felt jsut meh compared to so many cute cardigans. i do have a couple of grey ones and tried on grey, so perhaps i jsut dind\\'t need it... pros: short so would work with dresses and high waist. I purchased this dress for my bridal shower and it was perfect! the details on it are amazing-delicate and lovely! i am 5\\'11\\'\\' and it hit just above my ankles which i loved because i could show off my shoes! These little shorts have become my favorite. they are so sweet and feminine and very comfortable. the fabric washes very well Knitted & knotted are my new bff. their sweater dresses are amazing and i\\'m now tracking down sold out versions of their apparel to enhance my closet and have a party. i adore (and drool...just a lil bit) this dress. the colors and styling and warmth make me happy. i sized up to a l because of my linebacker shoulders/broad bust (thanks retailer user reviewers!) i am comfy as long as i don\\'t flail or flap. my one teeny tiny little complaint is right out of the factory cellophane bag, i had a loose I was so excited to buy it online, but it come in a small plastic bag, and lot of pieces are missing on the one i got, so i had to return it I love these pants! so comfortable and the material is so soft. Bummer, i loved the lacy bell arms and everything about the look of this sweater but it is huge in the abdomen. seriously looks maternity to me. the neck is also too wide. the quality of the material is very nice and the weight is nice and heavy but the cut just didn\\'t work on me. i returned this one. I really love this dress but i am still struggling with keeping it or not. i have an hour glass figure with a somewhat fullish behind :). it is tight around that area which i think it is meant to be but i am not sure how comfortable i am with that. i wasn\\'t sure about the belt but it really works. i am 5\"3 and weigh 118. i did have to size up from 2p to 4 p for it not to feel too tight in all areas. This vest is a really cute idea for layering, so i ordered my usual size medium. and while it fit, it just added about 5-10 pounds onto my frame! ehhh the front just has this extra fabric that you are supposed to bunch up and then tie down, but it just made me look so bulky! sizing down wouldn\\'t have helped as the back would have been squeezed in a small. it\\'s a shame because it seems pretty well made and comfortable too. i\\'m 5\\'6\", 140, and usually wear a 6 or 8. This is so adorable and flattering. dress it up or down with a denim jacket weekday to weekend.w/flats or pumps. love this cute dress. not all wool so it\\'s not itchy at all. the colors are vibrant and would compliment any complexion! A perfect basic tee!\\r\\nloved how soft it is. not worth full price, but definitely one to add to your cart once on sale. Bought a large, could barely pull up over my butt. runs extremely small. it\\'s cute but if your not a stick figure, this is not the suit for you. I purchased this in the black and received it today.  it is silky feeling and is a quality camisole.  the color is a muted black, not all shiny as some silks are (and they often look cheap) but this looks great and could be worn alone, under leather, or with a sweater/kimono.  i usually wear a medium in tops, and this fit true to size.  i am 5\\'2\" and it doesn\\'t look too long, but i do wish it came in a petite.  still keeping it! Beautiful dress for those with a large chest and small waist. sadly i am not one and needed to return the dress. fabric is heavy and the pattern is great. I have been continually disappointed in retailer\\'s clothing for the past year. i feel like their prices have soared and the quality has remained so-so, but dresses like these somehow make the cut. it does not make sense. since when did retailer exclusively market to older women? no, retailer\\'s market has always been young adults. this dress is extremely matronly. although the bottom print is nice, the hot pink belt?? is completely mismatched and gaudy. i really hope retailer starts curating better dress Dress ran very large in every way. beautiful design, lining and quality material. i should have sized down 2 sizes. item is now sold out. I love this shirt!!! the front is a little shorter than i thought it would be, but overall, it is so cute and comfy!! wish they had it in more colors!! There is nothing special about this skirt. it\\'s plain and incredibly dowdy looking. long and wide. i am usually between a small and medium. after reading the other review that said the waist ran small i went with a medium. it fit fine in the waist/hips. Loved the look, fit and styling of this turtleneck. but dry clean only, you have to be kidding? It\\'s hard to find a sweater that is warm and cozy, but doesn\\'t look bulky. this sweater does it all. it is delicate looking and soft and flattering. it is also surprisingly warm. i wear it with jeans for everyday, but it looks good enough to wear out to dinner or such. i bought the periwinkle which was the most flattering on me (blond and fair). i am hoping to get the green too when they go on sale. i said it runs a little small because i took a small instead of my usual extra small in sweaters. The color and quality of this sweater are fantastic. the reason i only gave it two stars is that the height of the neck didn\\'t seem right to me. it looked awkward and too high to be left standing upright, but when folded over i wished it were higher so it formed more of a turtleneck/cowl. i will be returning the sweater because of that. I rarely write a really negative review and retailer is my favorite store ever. but this dress is awful. i ordered the black and white. the fabric is very poor quality. the colors are washed out. i almost didn\\'t try it on, but i did and found that, for me, the fit was terrible (though some of the reviewer pictures are cute). I ordered a size xl in the pink version with the multi-colored fabric. the fit is true to size other than the length. it isn\\'t 27 inches. it\\'s the petite length even though i ordered the regular sizing. i ordered a 2nd one and again, the length was around 25 in. instead of 27. so, it will be more of a swingy, shorter top than shown. but, through the arms/body, it\\'s true-to-size. i\\'ll be dry-cleaning this so it won\\'t shrink since i need the length.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe colors and embroidery are exactly as pict Everything about this jumper is lovely- the color, the fit, the fabric. corduroy anything rules. but the first day i wore it the zipper was a problem. it was missing a tooth. my husband helped me work around that to zip it up for a sunday drive. i unzipped to nurse our baby and then we couldn\\'t get it back up and it just separated leaving me half dressed in the restaurant. was going to have it repaired but will send back now that i see they have more. i don\\'t know about y\\'all but i always feel a This is a beautiful kimono but just isn\\'t made well. the one i received already had a couple small holes and a pull in the thread that was very noticeable. after reading the additional reviewer who wore it an hour and it was already pilling, it is going back for good. such a shame! This dress arrived today in such a crumpled and wrinkled state that i was reluctant to even try it on. it is on the large size, but fine if you are looking for a very flowing look. longer at the front than shown in the photograph and i am 5\\'9\". i am sending it back. it is a pretty fabric, although shinier than expected. i am just not prepared to spend so much time pressing and steam ironing this item every time i want to wear it. I passed this sweater a few times during a recent visit to retailer. after striking out on several items i thought would work, i grabbed this sweater in the cream color. i loved it as soon as i put it on! it is meant to be oversized, which i love. the neck is chunky and looks good open or buttoned all the way to make a loose turtleneck. looks great with skinny jeans and booties. i went with my usual xs. great purchase! This was a fail for me. although i ordered size large it barely fit my midsection when tied and was too small in the waist. the fabric is nice though. best on thinner frames than mine. I love this vest. i think it is heavy for a warm spring/summer day so kind\\'ve surprised it was featured at the store early spring. i waited for it to go on sale and purchased my normal retailer size medium. i agree it may seem big or loose fitting but i am a vest girl and the fit for me is perfect. size 34 dd, 145 lbs and 5 ft 4 in height. it is a great finishing piece for causal or office attire. this vest will definitely stay in my closet for a long time. beautiful quality. I would absolutely recommend this dress if you have the right body type. This sweater would have been a better fit for me if the sleeves were slightly larger and had a button/snap on the front. the material is soft and comfortable. black pairs well with jeans. I\\'m 5\\'7\", 130 lbs. i ordered a medium-regular. the dress fell three inches above my knees. this model is taller than i am, and it falls to her knees....doesn\\'t make sense. i think retailer sends petites in place of regular. I generally don\\'t write bad reviews, but there is a real discrepancy between the quality of this kimono and the cost. the design and colors are great, but the fabric is ripping on all the kimonos on the rack in my store where the manufacturer\\'s tag is at the back of the neck. the material is very thin, so there are other small holes beginning throughout the garment. i shop at retailer all the time, and this is not a $98 item of clothing. I just received this dress wadded up in a bag. it is nothing like the colors shown on line. in the picture it appears blue and white. in actuality it is teal and a funky color of beigey pink. the top is see though but it does see have a slip under the skirt. will be sending it back and again remind myself why i shouldn\\'t try to buy a dress on line. Ok, received this in the mail yesterday and tried on this morning, i ordered the size 2 snd it is really big. i notice that the armhole sag and there is a lot of extra room everywhere. i am a 32d on the top so that is why i ordered the size 2, but i will return this and order the size 0 and i hope that will take care of the sagging arm area This is a fantastic skirt and very flattering. i plan to wear this with boots as shown on the model as well as sandals when it gets warmer. i would say that it does run true to size. This dress is really lovely. i purchased in the blue green color and think the pattern and ribbon detailing is gorgeous. it runs very small - i am normally a 00p in maeve, and in this dress, due to the length, ended up with a 2 regular. i like my dresses to fit and could have gone with the 0 - it fit well at the waist but was tighter than i prefer across the chest and wanted a more comfortable fit. as other reviewers have noted, it has a higher waist which i think contributes to the sizing issue I loved the star pattern of this top but the cut was odd. it is very big in the chest and full at the bottom. for anyone who is petite on top it tends to look sloppy. Would be flattering on someone who is slim with all the right curves. i\\'m average size and a mother of 3. the medium was not a true medium. the fabric was amazing. the arm holes were too open/low cut for my taste. \\r\\ni\\'m 5\\'7\" and 140. this landed mid calf. not my preference. \\r\\n\\r\\nretailer accepted the return with a hassel free refund all under 2 weeks from receiving it. I wanted to love this dress so much so that i ignored earlier reviews and purchased it in two sizes to see if i could make it work. the fabric is gorgeous, but the fit was very unflattering. it\\'s too large on top and hangs awkwardly in both sizes. i considered tailoring to make it work but with this pattern i felt like that would be a compromise. in the end i returned both sizes ast the fabric couldn\\'t compensate for the very unflattering fit. This is cut very strangely, i\\'m short waisted and this barely covered my belly button. the material is rough and scratchy. did not like at all and will be returning. I was on the fence about keeping but the more i tried it on, the more i liked it. i feel like it will be a great winter casual top the reason i was on the fence was because its pretty big. i\\'m 5\\'4 and 108 and the xs is pretty voluminous on me. it\\'s just so darn different and feminine though that i\\'m going to live with the fact that there is so much material. i think it is still cute. the fabric is also really soft on the inside so it will be cozy too. Ugh, i was so disappointed with this shirt. i was so excited when i saw it online and thought it would be a perfect summer shirt with the light colors and the flower print. unfortunately it falls flat and i understand now why they don\\'t have a straight on photo of the shirt, its very plain and lays very unflatteringly. it\\'s definitely missing something in the front. i typically wear a small to an extra small and i ordered this in an extra small and would have needed an xxs if i hadn\\'t returned i I was looking for a really warm, but stylish coat that i could wear when the weather is frigid as it sometimes gets here in the dc area. i tried on a size small, which is my usual coat size. while the coat fit, it was not flattering. for reference i am 5\\'9\" 128 pounds and usually wear a small/xsmall in retailer tops. in this coat i looked like a linebacker with pads on. the front material is doubled, which makes you look like you have a large protruding stomach. the shoulders are bulky and I originally purchased a small after reading some of the reviews. although it did fit, i felt it was just slightly snug across the chest and upper arms. i returned for a medium (my usual size) and it was perfect. it had the same look and flow as what you see in the model pics. i love love love that it is long-sleeved and has pockets!!!!! i went ahead and ordered the other print as well! i wore the first one to work with some knee high boots and got many compliments. highly recommend! Comfortable & the color was great. just as it looks in the picture. nice design This is a find! i am always on the hunt for a unusual lbd so when i found this on a \"found and collected rack\" i went for it. for starters, i am 5 foot almost 6 inches, and it the length ends just about the same place on this model. i usually wear a size 2 but when i tried on the size available in the store (oo), i felt i only needed a bit higher sizing bc i am small in the chest. i am barely a size 34 a and probably a 30d at best, and i barely can squeeze my chest into this dress at this size! I haven\\'t owned a skort in years! this one is super cute and so soft! i love the details, the asymmetrical cut and the buckles. i bought it in olive green. it fits really well. i\\'m 5\\'5\" 119 lbs with an athletic frame and i purchased a size 2 (my normal size). it fits comfortably around my waste and thighs/but with some wiggle room. \\r\\n\\r\\ni\\'m wearing it today w/ a navy blue/cream floral tank top, white/navy striped vans, and a gold dangly necklace. i love that its a versatile item and i\\'m looking f I thought this dress was lovely on. i\\'m an 8/10 and tried the med which i believe was the right fit. it may have fit a little large but i liked the way it hung. it has pockets and the color is absolutely beautiful. definitely buying if it makes it to sale. Very cute. a size small worked perfectly for me, fits like a glove. it has open sides so i wear a tank top under it. I read all the reviews and was hoping that this top would work for me, but it did not. i ordered a size smaller than usual and it was still way too big. it was not flattering at all on my curvy frame. overall, it looked more like a maternity top on me then anything else! if you\\'re tall and slender, i think this top would work! This dress is just so beautiful. i purchased the teal with beading at the hem. the beading is subtle and beautiful. i\\'m wearing this do a spring wedding, even though i believe it would be best in cooler months. i so wanted the plum option with the flower aplique at the hem - wouldn\\'t that be perfect for the spring wedding - but all gone!\\r\\nnote - the teal with the beading - the beading weighs a bit, enhancing the lines of the dress - doesn\\'t stick out, doesn\\'t make you look like your wearing a dr The dress didn\\'t meet my expectations, specifically the color, the texture, and the cut of the dress. although the dress was very well made, it just wasn\\'t right for me. Beautiful dress but the fit was off for me. overall this is good quality with beautiful lace detail. as the other reviewer mentioned the cutout in the back is very cute. i wanted to love this dress but i found it to run large in the top. i\\'m 5\\'6 130lb with 34c and i ordered the small, the top just hung off of me. perhaps it would have been better with an xs. I wanted to like this sporty dress too. i teach at an elementary school and like to get down on my knees st my students level - plus we can get messy most days with our learning and most days are go - go - go being \"on\" every second...the armholes were cut too big and weirdly squared. i didn\\'t like the middle \"ridge\" either as it was unflattering. it was returned. My conscience screamed at me not to buy this sweater and i wish i had listened! i noted the fact that it was acrylic and also the fact that it was oversized. but i also loved the design and can\\'t resist anything with mustard yellow. i was instantly disappointed when i received it, almost didn\\'t even try it on. how can they possibly charge $185 for terrible itchy 80\\'s acrylic? it looks cheap, it feels cheap and it didn\\'t even fit well. only redeeming quality: easily returnable! As soon as i saw this dress online i loved it and ordered it! unfortunately it just didn\\'t work for me, i tried it in a small, medium and large. for reference i\\'m 5\\'2\", 145lbs, 36d. the dress is really pretty in person, but i looked like a little girl in it. my daughter who is 4\\'9\", 100lbs, 34a, also tried it on and she too looked like a little girl in it. the material is beautiful along with the detail at the neckline, however the neckline is not open like in the picture, it\\'s more pushed toget I recently bought this dress and wore it once. i really liked it! it was comfy, cute and fit well. but... then i washed it. i followed the washing instructions exactly, but now it looks more like a shirt than a dress and it\\'s completely unwearable. i\\'m super disappointed because i thought this dress would be a wardrobe staple this summer. These embroidered jeans are very nice. they also exist in a lighter wash which i prefer because it shows off the embroidery better. the embroidery is dark navy which is almost not visible in these darker jeans. i guess if you like something very subtle these jeans are for you. i personally would have like a more contrasting color either white or red for the embroidery. these jeans are loose and expand with wear, it is perfectly ok to size down. Absolutely beautiful - \\r\\nusually don\\'t leave reviews here, but this top (material, beading, style) is so gorgeous i would be remiss if i didn\\'t. i have a short torso, so the peplum hit me above the belly-button. it\\'s very voluminous, but with the right pants and heels, it is a perfect outfit. as a full-time student, i\\'m apt to find retailer expensive - but this purchase was so very much worth it. in terms of sizing- i initially got the s to accommodate my bust (30f) but preferred the xs. I ordered both a small and a medium because i have lost weight and seem to be in between sizes currently. lately i am anywhere from a 6 to a 10 in most retailer sizes. almost 5\\'4\" and @140 lbs. i could have gotten away with the small. but my bust size is 36c/d. the small fit but didn\\'t hang as well or feel as comfortable around the chest as the medium. i agree with a previous reviewer that this romper does have a tendency to hang awkwardly at the waist until and unless you pull the drawstring tigh Ordered it because i am fan of floral dresses.\\ni found that colors are not as bright as pictured, overall color looks beige in real life. fabric has nice weight, not too heavy nor too light, it is not itchy, but not very soft either. good dress for colder weather. the sizing was right, i got my usual m and i am 5\\'10\\'\\' 145lb. the dress has a side zipper, but i did not need it. the dress is slimming and close to the body. the cut did not work for me: sleeves were too short, i had to pull them up t First of all, the fabric\\'s summery pattern of blossoms, honeybees and butterflies is beautiful and absolutely unique. i love it so much i wish i could afford to keep the dress as an art object. also, with one important exception, the dress is well made. the underslip is the right length and opacity. the dress is not transparent,\\r\\nwhich is a big plus. there is a slight greenish cast to the background instead of the pure ivory shown\\r\\nin the pictures. this makes the color a bit harder to wear. and I\\'m a big retailer buyer- and usually love the dresses, especially the petite xs maxis. this was the worst retailer purchase i have ever made. \\r\\n\\r\\nit was humongous and gave me no shape. even if i purchased an xxsp it probably would be the same. i\\'m small but i mean come on- this would only fit a giantess-- which also makes no sense because it\\'s the petite size. \\r\\n\\r\\ndo not buy. i\\'m very upset i have to pay the $5.95 return fee since i ordered this. I had such high hopes, but they are just slightly off. they run a tad large, so i suggest sizing down. (i usually wear a 28 or 29, and the 28 fit nicely through the hips and thighs.)\\r\\nunfortunately, the color is off- i thought they were going to be a dark midnight blue, but they are actually gray. and they have a button-fly closure which causes the pants to protrude a bit in the area where no woman wants protrusion. i will be returning them. This jacket was too wide and the length in the arms too short. i wear a medium in almost any article of clothing and felt like i was swimming in a short little jacket. the ratio of how wide it is to the length is not for me but might work well with other body types. the arms were definitely too short. Ordered size 12, it fits but pulls a tiny bit in the midsection. also way too long, hits below my knees. the dress is beautiful: crisp black color, nice fabric, great neck. it\\'s also the kind of dress that must fit well to look good. i had to return mine. I love the flowers on this top. the style is cute with the band at the waist. i ordered an extra small and it fits perfectly. I ordered this sweater in the pink color in a small and xsmall, in order to see which was the best fit. i was really looking forward to getting it because it looked so great online - like it had a nice flow, the cute zipper and was a good match for a pink and grey skirt that i have. i was really disappointed, the sweater doesn\\'t flow like it does in the picture - it kind of billows out in the front and back and isn\\'t flattering. i have a small build, and, frankly, i usually look good in sweaters I ordered the gray/plum colorway and while i\\'m disappointed in the large percent acrylic fabrication, the vest is very soft and warm. the unfinished raw seams add visual interest and i\\'m tempted to remove all the care tags and wear this inside out for a different look. i am worried that excess pilling will be an issue so i will update my review if the quality deteriorates beyond a simple lint shave. I love the top for its minimal fuss - no ironing, yay! definitely go 1 size smaller than your regular size. i got my usual small size but was swimming in it at the waist. the pattern and material are great! i bought the navy blue and might also get the yellow. i would have liked it to be slightly longer, since i have a curvy bottom. i am 140lbs and got the small. Fits great and goes great under cardigans and jackets They were too small for me. i loved them other than that. I saw this sweater online and have been looking for a unique sleevless sweater for some time now. its a very beautiful sweater so i ordered it right away when i saw this design. i recieved the sweater in the mail and really wanted to love it but it just wasn\\'t for me. its very well made and thick which i liked but i usually fit in small sized tops for retailer but they didn\\'t have a small left in the sizes, i ordered a medium and it still ran small, i was very surprised. its was also disappointing I\\'m 5\\'3\" and 120 lbs. i ordered a m and it was far too boxy and long in the arms as well as the back. the collar is small and lays flat. the material is good quality and soft but heavier than i had hoped. I love this top! the colors are beautiful & look incredible with jeans as well as so many of the different color pilcro pants in my closet. it\\'s the perfect between-season item.\\r\\nsince i don\\'t like garments that have a \"boxy\" fit, i was concerned that this top wouldn\\'t work for me after reading some of the other reviews. but it looks great & feels comfy. I bought this shirt in a l, since i didn\\'t want it to be too fitted and was concerned a m would be. it is so boxy! it\\'s like a completely different shirt. i have no idea how it looks good on anyone, unless it is simply widened the larger the size. maybe a m wouldn\\'t be as wide and therefore as boxy, but this shirt is just a bad mess. returning. I really love these leggings. the different textures that all the colors have make them interesting. quality is great. i am 5 1\" and 125lbs. the s/m fit pretty well but i wish there was a xs option. but still would not hesitate to buy again!! i actually went to retailer tonight to purchase all the other colors,...that\\'s how happy i am with this purchase! Love it! i usually wear a small but i just went to our local store and they only had a medium. i tried it on just in case and it fit perfectly. it is sitting pretty in my closet now. :) so if you are a size small, try ordering a medium and i hope it works for you as well. Again, nope. looks chic on the model, looked like a floor-length flannel nightgown on me. if you\\'d put a bonnet on me and stuck a candlestick in my hand, i could double for ebenezer scrooge in \"a christmas carol.\" i believe the word i used to describe it when i tried it on was \"shmata\" (yiddish for \"rags). it looked like i was wearing a rag. the ruching didn\\'t do anything to flatter my figure, the knit did not seem terribly warm for a sweater (felt more like rayon or nylon jersey than a knit swe Plan to order at least one size smaller than you think, it\\'s way baggy The lightweight knit and flattering colors made this top so perfect for me that i bought it for full price. it\\'s big, so i\\'d size down. you\\'ll still get a forgiving shape, flattering colors and just a really nice option for work or off hours. I found this piece very boxy and not very feminine. i tried to make it work but i just wasn\\'t feeling it the material is thin and the design is boring. unfort, it wasn\\'t for me. I purchased this shirt in blue and i like it. the fabric is more of a stretchy/jersey material - didn\\'t expect that. but the shirt looks decent on and is comfortable. Love this dress! wore it last night for a musical event... came home and put it on the hand wash setting in the washer with cold water...just as the label states. pulled the dress out and guess what? the design is completely faded!!! it looks 5 years old :( so sad. i\\'m going to call retailer and ask for a refund (i live two hours away) I ordered this dress and have sent it back. i think it could be a flattering dress; the waist hit quite a bit above my natural waist which made the entire thing fit weirdly. i am very long waisted, so this might just be a problem for me. i ordered regular size 2. I ordered this as it was either in stylist pick or top rated, cant\\' remember which, but i must say, ti was very nice on. a little loose, but the petite sizes are sold out, so i ordered the xs (petite might have been too short...) the cut is feminine, not figure hugging, but still flattering. i can see wearing this in the fall with boots and a cardigan, not just summer with sandals, so i decided to keep it.\\r\\n\\r\\n 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist. Comfortable top. would have been nice to have it a couple inches longer. pretty colors (the floral pattern). The dress has some cute features. the little belt motif hits too high on me and the drop waist is a little awkward. but it is comfortable and looks best with some kind of shirt worn underneath I found this as a return in the store. i tried the xxs. i was so excited because it looked really cute on the hanger. it was so huge- looked like i was wearing an xl. I am 5 6\\' and 130 pounds and ordered this in an xs. the sweater is enormous. the material is also scratchy and not soft at all. i\\'m disappointed with retailer\\'s sizing this year. i\\'ve had to return a # of xs items because they are huge. really disappointing. This is the widest sweater i have ever seen. i laughed out loud when i opened it, and then showed it around my office and everyone else cracked up too. it is comically wide. \\r\\n\\r\\neven when i was 9-1/2 months pregnant, the m/l would have been pretty roomy on me. now that i\\'m back to about a size 10-12, this looks like jared from subway\\'s pre-weight-loss pants, in sweater form. ridiculous! I love this dress (from the moment i saw it online), and now that it is on sale, i ordered it (green). i do wish the flesh color was a little more pink, love the color in person, but not as flattering on my pale skin (i ordered a different similar dress in teal and purple, that oclor was better).\\r\\n\\r\\nso, fit: like a glove: i am dd, in waist, lbs short = 0p. length was sexy, and overall great flattering fit. similarly to other dress, i wanted the length of this one, however. nice slightly above th I waited impatiently for this item to come in stock, and when it did, i had it overnighted because i was so excited to receive it. it\\'s hit or miss with me as far as retailer\\'s mediums and larges, depending on the brand. i generally err on the side of caution, so i ordered the large. it looked cute out of the package, but when i put it on i was terribly disappointed. it flared way out at the bottom, and was not as fitted through the waist as on the model. this could have been the large sizing, but The material is more like a great tee for the sleeves and the back, so it is so comfortable. i agree with the previous review, i am not thrilled about the hook and eye, but it still looks cute with a tank under it. i bought it in black and i am ordering it as well in white. it looks great with skinny jeans or pants. I ordered this in the pink color. the fit was fine, but i didn\\'t care for how thin it was. there is lining, which i suppose is there to combat the thinness, but it\\'s only in certain places. the lining should have been all over. maybe if i had gotten this in blue, it wouldn\\'t have been so bad. The pattern and fabric on this dress are very nice. there is just too much fabric. it\\'s much too baggy but could make a nice maternity dress. i\\'ll be returning it. Very comfortable, flattering, washes nicely- love it! Got this in the sky color. returned it because the top is way too sheer for me, if you know what i mean. i wanted a pretty gown i can wear without a robe in front of my kids. no can do. also, for the price, material just felt flimsy & cheap. it does run small ~ the medium was good on me and i\\'m 5\\'2\", 114#, 34b Loved this dress until i tried it on! it was too big in the body and tight on top in the arm area. from the reviews already posted stating the guy was great, i\\'m wondering if i just received a defective dress? i also wish the dress were a truer orange/mango color instead of a burnt orange since this dress is for spring/summer. This dress looks cute online, but it is enormous. i bought a small, but it looked more like a 3x plus size. i tried it on, just in case, and honestly it looked like a great dress for a clown. this dress must have had two feet of fabric pinned behind the model in the photo. I was so excited to get this in the mail, and so disappointed when i put it on. it had a nice feel to it and fit well when i zipped it up, but i don\\'t really know how to adequately describe what it looked like when i glanced in the mirror - lumpiness along the seams? i don\\'t know if it was a manufacturing flaw or not, but it gave me lumpy-looking hips and then kind of clung around my mid-thigh area. returned it the next day. This is cut very strangely, i\\'m short waisted and this barely covered my belly button. the material is rough and scratchy. did not like at all and will be returning. Beautiful well fitting top. you can\\'t tell from the picture but the entire top is sheer so you need a tank or camisole underneath. I was extremely excited to receive these pants, given the two positive reviews. i\\'m a petite woman and have trouble finding jeans with the right proportions. i sized down from my normal size (27 to a 26) and was swimming in these pants. i would have had to go down three sizes to make these work. i\\'m not sure if i received a defective pair or what, but be cautious ordering these pants. This top is gorgeous and i exchanged it 3 times hoping it would work. i originally got the size a would normally wear (a 6).and the arm holes and top were extremely tight and the top was short so i sized up and still had the same problem. i then went all the way up to a size 14 in order to get the length of the shirt log enough but now it is quite large around my hips. i love the detailing of the shirt but unfortunately if you have any chest at all it will not fit Nice warm long cardigan that can work for many seasons. works well over a dress. I love the pure and good short sleeve tees. they feel beautiful, and wash beautifully! i just hang them to dry and they are perfect for the next time, i buy a size medium as i like them to flow nicely at the hips! This looks great on the model but when it arrived, i couldn\\'t believe it was the same jacket. it looks a bit like a really loose garbage bag on me and no amount of adjusting drawstrings is going to fix it. i really wanted to like it, but even the xs/s was too baggy. also a bit worried based on other reviews that it isn\\'t actually a rain jacket and wont keep you dry. I was looking for a coat to wear over dresses. this one is the perfect length and works over all lengths of dresses (and looks awesome with jeans too). my only concern is how it will hold up in the rain - it hasn\\'t happened yet! Loved this online, but the xs was too big and the material was too bulky. When i ordered this all the petite sizes were no longer available. i tried the xs. it was actually a nice length for me (5\\'4\") and even the arm openings were not too large which is a plus. i expected all the extra flow and material on the back of the tunic but there was too much fabric on the front too...very unflattering. if it had been a closer fit on the front i probably would have kept it. the color is very nice but the fabric is pretty standard...nothing that makes it stand out. it is very Just received these and they fit perfectly, but the panels are different shades of gray. the color is not consistent and it make them look bad. they are perfect otherwise, but sadly they are not wearable. i will be returning I was really hoping to like this, but it did not look the way it does on the model, at least not on me. the sharkbite hem is much more pronounced and looser. the one in the photo looks like it was pinned back. i am 5\\'8\" and usually wear a medium or large. i got a medium and there was a lot more material on the bottom half than the photo shows. it made me look bigger and was not flattering. material has a nice weave but it\\'s thin and delicate. i bought the (holly) deep olive and the blue. colors Good quality jeans, but had to return, as they did not fit my curvy hips. Note the sleeves on the model. that is how your regular size will fit your arms. however, even if you have skinny arms like i do, the sleeves will be tight. i bought my regular size xs and it was clingy with an odd flair and the length seems as though i ordered a petite and i am only 5 ft 2 in.\\ni advise to try a few sizes on if you really are interested. the red is truly a red which is a good thing because so often it is hard to find a red that is not neon. This sweater was not as featured in the picture. the front is completely cropped while the back is regular length. the front barely reached the middle of my stomach. also, the color was not as vibrant as shown in the picture. this sweater will be going back. This tops is super cute and great transitional shirt for the fall. a little short in the front but still a great shirt. A sweet tunic with the distinctive lace hemline. the length is great - just right to wear with skinny jeans or over leggings. not too long but long enough for comfort over leggings! more of a boxy fit (just as expected). wore it with my skinny jeans and short boots and got many compliments. I wanted to like this one.. really but it was just plain sloppy looking. i returned it. I really couldn\\'t tell if i like the dress or not - it was swimming on me and i always wear a size small. design is great with cross straps in the back, thin, silky fabric. i would call the color more of a bright coral/orange - not a bright red.i\\'ll get back if i decide to try ordering the xs. . . I wear a 32 and sometimes a 31 but i could barely squeeze these on in a 32. the fabric is thick with lots of stretch but these are super skinny all the way to the ankle like a legging and not a jean. made for much thinner frames than mine. I was so excited when this dress went on sale.  it is very soft and the print is so distinctive.  it is super comfy but not slimming or flattering at all.  i am a curvy girl,  wear a medium 8/10 and this made me look so wide!  the skirt is quit full,  a small would have fit but the top was tight.  so disappointing. I bought this in wine in both the small and medium. both fit but am keeping the medium since it drapes better and looks like the photo with longer length in body and sleeves. light material is a great weight since heavy sweaters can be too hot in heated offices. style can be dressed up or down for office or weekend. have ordered the blue and grey. only concern is how well the fabric will launder. This skirt is definitely not what i was expecting. the material is stiff and rough. the skirt is also loud. you can hear it swishing when you move, and not in a classy way. it feels like you\\'re wearing a very long tutu. also, the pattern isn\\'t quite as pretty in person. they must have used magic in order to make this skirt look flowy in the photos - it does not flow. This blouse is a disappointment . fabric is cheap looking and the cut is very off. just odd. sleeves awkward . the back of the white shirt on the on-line model is not the same as the white shirt i received. mine was plain in the back like the blue shirt on line even though my shirt was white. no ruffle. returned. Ordered the biggest size available, the large. the arms are so tight, i couldn\\'t get it on. looked like it may have fit in the body so i don\\'t understand why so constricting in the arms. i don\\'t have big arms, either. fabric is thin but the color is pretty. can\\'t recommend. i\\'d pass on this one. This dress is very pretty but only the bottom is lined. the top is completely see through and you would need to wear a tank or slip underneath. i wanted a dress i could just throw on and not have to layer so it didm\\'t work for me. but if you don\\'t mind layering or your bra peeking through, it\\'s still a very beautiful dress. i\\'m usually a petite in most things but this wasn\\'t available in p so i ordered an xs. the length was good (not too long, not too short) but it was cut way too low for me. on I feel that for this price, i should love this top (and i wanted to). however, the price is on the high side for a relatively basic top, and there were a few things about it that could be improved.\\r\\npros: i ordered a medium and feel that it\\'s pretty true to size. additionally, the fabric is nice and light (but also *sheer*) and, generally speaking, has a nice pattern. overall, it\\'s a very pretty top.\\r\\ncons: there\\'s a cute criss-cross ruffle thing happening in the back but the model has cleverly Love this dress so much! i bought the cranberry color first, and i loved it so much, that i also bought it in black. i think it runs fairly true to size. i am 5\\'3\" and about 110, and the xs petite fit perfectly. i tried the xs, and it was pretty large on my frame. i love the fabric and flow of this dress, and i love the pockets. The shirt is beautiful, but fits much too small. the stitching limits the space in your shoulders, and the hem too short. a petite frame would be able to pull this off- but i am a 5.10\" medium, and the shirt didn\\'t work in every direction. Cute style, flowy fabric. it runs big i purchased a medium and could\\'ve definitely gotten a small. Very cool top! i purchased this in the black, which is more of a very dark gray (imagine sanded silk). it\\'s very figure flattering and accentuates curves. it also disguises any minor tummy issues. not to clingy, but follows your form. the fabric is well made with a perfect drape to match the style. definitely a winner! On the real...i needed a sweater they gave my tummy some room! what yes i\\'d love some more pumpkin pie. know what im saying?! what appeared to be lack of constriction in the belly region of a tiny model, made me hope with fingers crossed it would look like that on me. please please just swing and not cling. mmmmm...k. the majority (70%) of the fabric content is natural and a sale was going on so i went for it and purchased this sweater online. so glad i did! Nice, flowy, comfy top with soft fabric. there\\'s a lot of fabric below the waist - it could probably work as a maternity top - but it drapes nicely rather than looking overwhelming. i do find that the buttons gap a little at the chest, despite the top fitting loosely on me, so i have to wear a layer under it. I loved the look of this sweater, but the workmanship was surprisingly poor. there were missed stitches, and loose threads throughout, and even a tag sewn to the outside. retailer was great about the return. i really wanted to keep it and was very disappointed. These pants are just as beautiful in person as on the website. the fabric is luxuriously soft. two things to note: they are very lightweight jersey material, and they run a bit small. if you\\'re in between sizes, you might want to size up. it\\'s possible they\\'ll stretch while wearing. i also wish they had pockets, but they just have a one small back pocket that\\'s not sewn down and seems made for perhaps a tissue but nothing else. all of these \"flaws\" are made up for by the fact that these are abso Personally i love cloth and stone. . this top however sheer is still a nice top to have in my rotation. it is thin, lightweight, and sheer but with a cami or nude bra can be pulled off nicely.. i did find the top to be tts for me but the sleeves were snug. i purchased this on sale with extra 30 percent off so i was justified in getting it.. I purchased this gaucho as a gift for my mother.\\r\\nat first, i was about to try it for myself because gaucho is a little trend nowadays.\\r\\nbut later, it turned out that it was a perfect fit for my mother.\\r\\nit went well with her perhaps because she saved a lot of her fashion from 1980s.\\r\\nit also fit well with contemporary fashion as well.\\r\\nhowever, i think it matches better with vintage fashion than to contemporary fashion.\\r\\nso, if you happen to save those \"good old fashion\", take them out and try This sweater is very long, could be worn as a dress at 5\\'3 ! I bought this jacket based on how it looked on the model, and from the reviews. i found it to be super big, and unflattering to say the least. i\\'m 5\"10, 155lbs. i sent it back. I got the blue. it is very short. one side of the shirt i received was shorter that the other. the material feels cheap and pleats out a bit right over the bust - only flattering on small busted models. The back of this top is very unique and the embroidery looked like it would hold up.\\nit does have a boxy shape, but it really works with this piece. i found it to run true to size compared to other pieces i have from retailer. for some reference, i\\'m 5\\'5\" and weigh 148lbs. I don\\'t normally review my purchases, but i was so amazed at how poorly this dress was made, i couldn\\'t help myself but to post a review. the neck line isn\\'t even hemmed down so it flaps up. the material is thin and feel cheap. this dress isnt even worth $20 in my opinion. i was expecting a well made, good quality dress for the high price tag. I ordered these along with the regular ag stevie jeans and there is a definite difference in fabiric and cut. i liked the darker fabric but it was thinner and stretchier that the more \"denim\" version. the cut was also looser in the thigh and seat area which made for a looser, less flattering fit. returned it and kept the regular ag stevie. This dress was so pretty on the hanger but a saggy sack on. even the sz 0 was too loose and shapeless. there is no waist as pictured. the hi-low hem, loose fit and wavy waist seam (see in the third close-up picture) make it look like the dress shrunk oddly in the wash. it\\'s really too bad, it\\'s such a pretty combination of patterns. I was so excited to buy it online, but it come in a small plastic bag, and lot of pieces are missing on the one i got, so i had to return it Putting my two cents in regarding how fantastic this dress is! i bought the medium petite in navy stripe. it fits great, it\\'s not too clingy and it\\'s flattering to my disproportionate figure (makes me look more hourglass). Oh dear. the elastic waistband just ruined this skirt for me--it made it look so cheap. i assumed from the photograph that the skirt was a knit over a structured lining with a real waistband with a zip. instead, it\\'s a sweatshirt knit with no lining and elastic. it looked cheap and hung a bit baggy from the elastic waist, making it a no-go for me. This is a cute top, but not worth the price in my opinion. i love the colors, pattern and soft material used. however, the fabric is quite thin and just not worth paying $58. I love this little chemise! the adjustable straps sold me because i\\'m petite. i generally wear a small/27p. i\\'m about 5\\'1\", 124 lbs. i purchased a small and it fit perfect! the fabric is nice, not too thin or too thick. i would totally wear it just as easily as a nightgown or beach coverup. i\\'ve never been able to wear scrappy dresses, but it could probably pass for one of those too. it\\'s flattering and pretty without being too \"pretty\", if you get my meaning. This shirt is beautiful. it is flowy and light, a perfect piece for transitioning from winter to spring. however, do not follow the washing instructions on the tag. it says you can machine wash, tumble dry low, and despite going one step further and washing on my gentle cycle in cold water and drying it on extra low, it came out of the wash so small that a child could barely wear it. it went from being a tunic to an inappropriate crop top i will never wear again. if you do order, please take the I purchased the grey jacket first and it seems to work with a lot of things and create different looks. so i purchased the tan jacket. i found it to less tan as an olive color. not my favorite color for me. but the fit is awesome and hopefully the color will prove to be versatile too. the blouse shown with it does not go with it as i had hoped.\\nthe jacket seems very green with the golden brown in the blouse. so a black or ivory blouse with some great necklace should work. recommend. pretty true This is so close to perfect, but there\\'s a seam down the middle of the back and they didn\\'t bother to match the polka dots. you can see the mismatch in the second photo. i was about to buy the jacket, and totally in love, when i turned and saw the error. i hoped it was one bad match, but nope, on every one. couldn\\'t unsee, didn\\'t buy. very disappointed. At 5\\'4\", i guess i am just too short to pull this dress off! the colors are so pretty for summer, but there is just too much fabric... i felt like i was wearing a giant doily! however, there is not a doubt in my mind that taller girls would look fabulous in this! While i love the fabric and the pattern, this skirt leaves too much to be desired. the full price is absurd considering what you get.\\r\\nthere is no mention online that there is no built in slip, and as the material is extremely thin a slip is an absolute must. (see attached photo.) even in dim lighting you can see straight through. \\r\\nalso for this price point it is strange that the skirt is \\'pull-on styling.\\' i would say that it is true to size, and i am usually a medium @ retailer, but i have a sm I was unsure about the color when i got it in the mail but it is very flattering. it is roomy for sure. with a pair of slim shorts or pants it looks great though. creasing may be an issue. 5ft 6, 135 lbs 36 d...the xs looks good with room to spare.\\r\\nnice weight fabric for fall. I tried this dress on in an xs petite. the dress runs slightly bigger, it sort of looked like a tent on me, whereas other xs p dresses at retailer fit tts. the other thing is that the dress just doesn\\'t look like an almost $200 dress. the band that runs across the bust goes under the arms too. it isn\\'t sewn in though, and it was folding down under the arms, making it look like its ripping off. the collar too seemed to pull down right in the center, as if the material was too heavy to stand it\\'s we I have the purple and the white. i purchased the purple first in m. it wasn\\'t too big to return, but it was a little roomier than necessary but when i saw the white on sale, i purchased it in s which fit just fine--still plenty roomy as the style allows. both these are cute alone and also with a little sweater or denim jacket. i haven\\'t washed them yet but i imagine washing on delicate with a good gentle detergent will keep them looking nice for a long time. I ordered in blue. so excited at arrival; it looked gorgeous...then i tried it on! i\\'m 5\\', 106#, 34d and my upper arms are a little muscular. i normally order 2p (sometimes 0p)...and never a problem. this top was sooo tight under the arms and at the upper arms...if i tried any movement would have probably ripped out the seams! maybe i just received a product that was mis-sized, or defective. all i can say, if you have skinny arms, you\\'ll love it. I bought this top in black. it is high quality material and i love the mock neck and zipper in back.  however, not only are the armholes are too large, the shirt is cut too short. if i size down for smaller armholes, it becomes a crop top, not a flattering look for 50-something me. i really wanted this to work, but alas, it went back. The dress arrived wrinkled so i washed it and pressed it. it looked beautiful until i sat down. the entire dress was wrinkled and it looked terrible all day. can\\'t wear this again. I\\'m very pleased with this jacket! i\\'ve never owned a \"vegan\" leather anything, so i didn\\'t know if it would show up cheap looking or smelly.. but to my surprise, it didn\\'t have a \"smell\" or that shiny cheap look. i\\'m so glad i headed the other reviewers advise and i sized up, my typical size would have been to tight and short! i\\'m excited to wear this with dresses and jeans this fall! i bought the \"honey\" color and it\\'s more like a cross between beige and blush(a slight dusty pink hue)! i love Haven\\'t seen a top as fun and unique as this without being \"too much\" in a long time. i typically like a little longer with skinny jeans/leggings but this does the job of hitting at a good spot just at my crotch and the bottom of my behind. it\\'s the right amount of swing at the bottom to wear out (not sure i could tuck it in and make it look right as in the photo), the \"bell\" at the sleeve bottoms adds just the right amount of detail as does the neck detail and ties. the color is beautiful and i This suit is absolutely gorgeous but it really will only fit a very short waisted gal. it fit perfectly in the body and in the bust but just was not long enough for me to lift my arms up and my size c cup boobs to not pop out. i was very sad to return it :( i am a size 8 with c cup boobs and ordered it in a medium There is no possible bra to wear with this top. after one washing the neck felt funky. the pink color is very light. it\\'s long enough for leggings. my shirt is a high hemline on one side than the other. i\\'ll wear it but wish the neck wasn\\'t so funky. I love the style the lightness and the fit ... but the fabric in the skirt just did not meet my expectations. this might be something to find at a mass retailer. i guess i simply prefer a natural fabric. This blouse has too much drapey fabric and it\\'s just not flattering.  in the front part of the blouse the fabric is relatively short, but the sleeves have so much excess fabric it almost looks like a clown suit.  sending back. Not a summer dress even though the photos make it seem like it\\'s for hot weather. the weight and layers and synthetic fabric is very substantial. it is a bit scratchy where there is maroon fabric, but not intolerable. i love this dress but it\\'s beyond a-line, it\\'s a tent. i\\'m keeping and will wear for fall with a long sweater to flatten the fullness that\\'s seen in profile. for my body type (top heavy, thick shoulders/back/upper arms), i chose the smaller of my size range. definitely size down if I had such high hopes for this top. it is beautiful but it is very uncomfortable! the lace/beadwork is extremely itchy. the button at the neck seems cheap and i was worried it would fall off. the beadwork and lace puckered on my shoulders making the fit off for me. I\\'m so incredibly disappointed. the dress is beautiful but the one i received is torn and has multiple strands of beads missing. poor quality control. I ordered this in an xs, which is my normal size in retailer tops. the stitching and detail on the straps is beautiful, but they were also somewhat tight across my bust and across my back. it puckered in a strange way that wasn\\'t flattering. back it goes, unfortunately. This dress did not work well on my figure. i have a small waist and broad hips, and the dress (size m for 140 lbs, 5\\'8\") was too boxy. i didn\\'t have objections to the fabric, like other reviewers - honestly, even if there were a snag or two, the fabric is kind of rustic and i don\\'t think a snag would look terrible, depending on where it is. i should note that one of the ornamental buttons immediately fell off the dress upon arrival. my friend got the same dress in a size s and it worked better f Loved the look of this shirt online. i tried it on and was sad to see that the frontal view is all wrong. the cool shoulder design is almost too exaggerated (almost looks as if i\\'m ready for take off!). unfortunately, none of the featured photos on the product page display the frontal view of the model. i really wish the shoulder design was slightly smaller in shape and size - i would have loved it! looks great from the side but sadly i can\\'t walk around like that ;) The first time i wore this tank it started pilling around the arms and down the sides. it is terribly quality, and gets worse with every wear and wash. possibly the worst wear on a new clothing item i\\'ve ever seen. like the design and fit, immediately relegated it to a weekend/home shirt because it was unprofessionally pilly and the pills are small so can\\'t be shaved off. The material and construction of the pants are great, but the length is just plain awkward. i\\'m 5\\'4\" and the regular came to just above my ankles, and looked as though they had shrunk in the wash in a really bad way. a couple of inches longer and they would\\'ve been fine, or i could\\'ve gotten them in petite and worn them as true ankle-length pants, but the regular just didn\\'t do it for me. also i\\'m usually a size 6 (5\\'4\", 125lbs) and these were a little baggy around the waist and hips. Dress runs very large. quality is great and the pockets are a great addition. Bought these for the color however these just did not work for me. the 26 was too small and the 27 was baggy. i\\'m 5\\'3 and typically wear a 26. beautiful color and good denim. if you are looking for a looser fit, more of a straight leg fit...this is a good jean with a fun pop of color. This dress is great if you\\'re very skinny and have no chest. otherwise, it makes you look dowdy. the colors are also quite washed out and do nothing for my complexion.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis one is going back. This dress has special written all over it. the poms at the hem and bodice, as well as the rows of black seed beads push are the kind of details that stand out. i like all the varying textures. it looks great with sandals or short boots. fits true to size. a nice sassy length. I\\'m 5\\'7\", 130 lbs. i ordered a medium-regular. the dress fell three inches above my knees. this model is taller than i am, and it falls to her knees....doesn\\'t make sense. i think retailer sends petites in place of regular. Yes! i love the color, the fabric and the fit up top. the skirt, however, is very poofy. i am going to let it hang for awhile (it was an online order) and see if some of that relaxes. otherwise, i will need to return it. Comfortable and cute. versatile colors that can be worn with virtually anything. Love the movement of the blouse and how it falls. great quality material. Was very disappointed with this dress. it\\'s very baggy, no shape. felt like an oversized sack. purchased in med. bust area was only semi good fit all else flopped :( Looks fitted on, but this just turned out to be an oversized muumuu on. the fabric also felt cheap. Cute top but does stretch out a bit throughout the day. I was extremely excited to receive these pants, given the two positive reviews. i\\'m a petite woman and have trouble finding jeans with the right proportions. i sized down from my normal size (27 to a 26) and was swimming in these pants. i would have had to go down three sizes to make these work. i\\'m not sure if i received a defective pair or what, but be cautious ordering these pants. This dress is super cute and sexy. i bought the taupe in a size medium. for reference i\\'m tall (5\\'11) and weigh about 152. i don\\'t know how tall the last reviewer is but this was not too short in the front for me. i really like it. These are so comfy. i will wear them for 3 seasons. so worth it - especially on sale. Comfortable,t eh fabric is very soft. the embroidery adds a little to the otherwise plain black tunic. lace up neck on trend too. \\r\\n\\r\\ni ordered the xxs p, as it is likely loose... that was just fine for me, xs p would have been not as flattering. theo nly problem with that is the sleeves then became a little more snug (workout arms). not too snug that i can\\'t wear the dress, but decided not to keep it only because there are way too many things i like at retailer! (and have to pick). in my wish lis The armholes on this dress are totally bizarre. i can\\'t believe no one else has commented on them yet. i am a size s on top and m on the bottom so i usually try on both in dresses. i tend to be a small/ size 6 in retailer. the armholes are so long that the dress doesn\\'t lay right on top. i showed it to on of the clerks in the store and she agreed with me. we looked at all the others and they were the same. going up a size made it way worse. this dress might work for someone with really broad shoul I saw this duster and immediately ordered it in cream. i have worn it every chance i get. it goes well with dresses as well as shorts or jeans. the length is perfect, the design is flattering, and the material is soft and comfortable. the sleeves are snug- but i like this feature, especially for light weight summer use over a tank top or sleeveless blouse. this will be a go to item. thanks retailer- another gem! Cute top but started disintegrating after two washes. the delicate cutouts in the top tore apart. i machine washed it in the gentle cycle and didn\\'t use the dryer. disappointed to have to discard the top after just buying it. I just love sleeping on snow sweaters and this one is no exception. it\\'s soft and cozy and very warm. i do have sensitive skin, so i found this a bit itchy right away, but that went away after i wore it for a bit. this is oversized, but in a great way. you could size down if you wanted something a bit more fitted. sleeves are long and pre-cuffed. sweater hit me mid-lower thigh. I saw this dress in the catalog and immediately ran to the store to purchase. then i realized the dress in the catalog is slightly different, but the small differences is what makes the catalog dress so much more unique and worth the money! look at the top, the stripe colors are different. and the stripes flow different on the skirt part as well. and the dress was short on me and i\\'m two inches shorter than the model. bummer. I really wanted to love this shirt. the fit was great, and the fabric just felt beautiful. luxurious, soft and flowing. but the collar was frayed... in addition, the little keyhole area fabric also had to be carefully handled to make it look smooth and not like bad workmanship. i put it aside to return it, then this morning went to have another look at it, wanting to talk myself back into it. but i can\\'t overlook the fact i\\'d be ordering a new shirt that would look time-worn. it may be only this Today i happened to walk into my favorite store with an already reduced 30percent off sale sign. i tried on this pants and let me tell you-wow!! they are super comfy and made my behind look great!! i will definitely start wearing these asap!! I just bought this tee in red. i have worn it and washed it once. i noticed that there is a hole already by the top of the pocket. considering the price, i would hope that it lasts for more than one season. This sweater is very pretty, i love the knit and the cream color. for some reason it just didn\\'t flow the way i wanted it to, and i didn\\'t love the v neck. just didn\\'t pull me in completely! I was skeptical about buying a romper. i was also unsure what size would fit me (i\\'m 5\\'5\" and 150 lbs.)  to my delight, the romper fit perfectly! it\\'s a gorgeous and flattering fit.  i love the design and fabric!  it\\'s stunning! It\\'s beautiful, lovely quality, gorgeous bird. but the fit just doesn\\'t work for me. i\\'m usually a medium, which is what i got, it\\'s just too tight in the chest. for ref 36d. as is it already flares out some in the bottom so i\\'m not gonna bother w a larger size unfortunately Regretfully, this dress is on its way back for an exchange. the dresss is beautiful and fits true to size, i ordered it in both colors, however, the black has a defect in the lace right on the front of the dress, and the white was tearing in a few spots under the arms and on the bottom. again, the dress is so pretty and i am hoping retailer will find me one without bunching, pulls , or tears for an exchange, but i can\\'t pay 130\" for a dress that is already torn. I really liked this shirt the one time i got to wear it...but when i washed it, according to the directions on the tag, it shrunk! a lot! the sleeves are now too tight, and it is much shorter. thinking about returning it to the store, but in any case, i cannot wear it again. I\\'m fussy about robes. i\\'m fairly small (size 2 or 4) and a lot of robes swamp me. in the smaller size, this robe fit well and was flattering. the material is soft but absorbent. the pattern is lovely and feminine without being dowdy. the wrap is generous--i wear this robe just out of the shower and don\\'t feel exposed. I usually wear small, ordered xs and it\\'s still way too large. quality not that great, just meh, returning it. I\\'m happy the other reviewers made this dress work because it looked terrible on me. i\\'m 5,9\" and 128 lbs and it made me look like i had gained 25 lbs. as others have said, the pockets make the dress even worse-it\\'s very hard to get them to lay flat. the material is lovely, soft and i liked the gray color, but this dress made me feel like i was wearing something from an asylum. Tried this on in store and it runs very small. i am a size 4, but have curvy hips, so i sized up to a size 6 and i couldn\\'t even button it. i was hoping it was more of an a-line, but it\\'s fit more like a pencil skirt. not very flattering on my body type. overall, cute design, but not for me. This sweater has potential, but it wasn\\'t right for me. the collar isn\\'t flattering on me...too thick, and my shoulders are already broad. my waist is high, so i need a longer look. the color is true to size, but it\\'s s little see through...dark bra shows through. This is a very sexy suit. it took some time to figure out how to put it on. it needs instructions, but it is well worth it. I tried on an xs and it was boxy/roomy in the torso and the pocket on the wrist/forearm area made my arm look too bulky when i rolled the sleeves up like the model pictured. i love the idea of a relaxed fit cropped leather jacket in a versatile taupe color but when i tried this one on in person, it took me back to my childhood. i used to help my dad wash his cars when i was a kid and he used a leather chamois (\"shammy\" for short) that was awesome for soaking up water. and that\\'s what it felt lik As a beach cover-up this would be great, but i\\'m surprised retailer calls this a dress and doesn\\'t show on the model how thin it is. it\\'s pretty sheer and i couldn\\'t get away without layering it. This bunches up too much, and the fabric is even more see through than i expected (so even with a tank top under it, it\\'s not a good look for work). even unbuttoned at the top, i could barely get this over my head!  this one is going back. I have to agree with the first reviewer! i really loved the color of this dress and could almost have overlooked the lack of a lining, but when i felt the fabric expecting a nice lush silk, instead getting what felt like a polyster instead i couldn\\'t justify it for the price. i really liked the fact that a maxi came in petite sizes as well, but just couldn\\'t get over the poor quality for that price so back it goes! \\r\\n\\r\\ni hope the team members or buyers at retailer are reading these reviews This tank is soft and flexible. great fit with wonderful material. very pleased. I like the dress on line: color flowers, cut, etc. but when i tried it on it was just meh... the color did wash me out a bit, the flowers are still beautiful, but the cut wasn\\'t as flattering on my body as it was on the model. 0p fit ok, but i didn\\'t keep it. you ahve to tie your own shoulder straps, so adjustable, i guess that is a plus.\\r\\n\\r\\n115 lbs 30 dd, 26.5 in waist This flew out of my local store so fast i had to order on line. simply stunning. was reluctant to pay high price but worth it. will get much wear. The first thing i noticed upon receiving this dress is how soft it is and the fact that it wasn\\'t wrinkled coming out of the packaging bag- an excellent quality! my next surprise was to find that it is fully lined with a very nice soft knit and felt awesome on. i ordered a size small and it fit perfectly- it was fitted through my waist and hips (37 chest, 28.5 waist, 37 hips) and dropped straight from my hips just like i like. i was afraid it would be too sheath like for my figure but it is perf Giving 3.5 stars due to how big this dress runs. i am 5\\' 118lbs and i was swimming in the xs. it is a beautiful dress, just beware it runs very large. I bought this in the blue stripe and the color is not what is shown at all! the photo shows a bright, vibrant blue and white stripe top. i got a white and very light pastel blue stripe top. so disappointed because the top doesn\\'t have that wow look as shown in the photo. however, it goes well with blue jeans even in the lighter shade of blue.\\r\\n\\r\\nand, the fabric is nice and cool for hot summer days. the fit is tts. i bought a 16 and if you wear an 18 this will fit also. i didn\\'t find this too box I really loved the material and the feel of this item, however it does run very large. even though it is meant to be loungewear it is great as a top with skinny jeans or leggings. I ordered a size 4, my usual size is a 4 or 6. the tunic fit well through the torso, but the arm length was too short and hit just below the elbow. the sleeve interfered with arm bending and moving. i have petite proportions so the arm length of regular size garments is usually too long. i don\\'t want to go up in size because the body of the tunic might be too roomy. I wore this for the first time today, and after just about an hour, it gently nicked something and got a hole in the pack.  its so disappointing as i love they style and its so comfortable. very poor quality for the price :( I have a love-hate relationship with this dress. the fabric and print are beautiful but like most swing styles, this dress doesn\\'t work if you\\'re curvy. tried on an xs in the store which was huge, ordered an xxsp, the length was perfect but the dress does nothing for a pear-shape. looks marginally better cinched in with the belt but i was lost in all the fabric and the skimming nature of the dress did nothing for me. as my boyfriend said, \"that looks like something you\\'d wear if you were pregnan Beautiful and versatile dress but shoddy quality. i hand washed (per the instructions) it after wearing it once  and the sleeves are already falling apart. I purchased this dress as an easy option to throw on after the gym or on a weekend trip without fuss. the fabric is soft, hangs well, and it is well-lined. but it\\'s also a little more bilious than perhaps necessary to be beautiful and flowing. as in, i\\'m very comfortable in this dress, but it\\'s not a dress i receive compliments while wearing. perhaps it reads as maternity wear without the belt. I bought this dress in burnt orange for my 19 year-old collage daughter. she loved it and has found many opportunities to wear it on campus. she said it is so comfortable and perfect with a sweater for cool fall mornings and sleeveless as the day warms up. Not a huge fan of this dress, will be returning it.\\nfits too big and not flattering.\\nfabric is thin and shows any lumps and bumps you may have.\\ncolor is not as pretty in person as in the photo - the photo looks like a nice rust color but the dress is actually a boring brownish olive. Very nice fabric and quality but runs very large. i had to return my pair of a size 0. stinks to pay for shipping on a product that looks so different in the picture. Originally bought the plaid version and retuned it to order this one in the store to get free shipping. the fit is completely different. i am a consistent small, particularly in dresses of this style. will be exchanging this for a medium, which i hope will fit. love the color and pattern. This didn\\'t work for me.  the piece looked cheap, rode very high...needed to be longer.  the piece looks incomplete for some reason to my eyes.  it also does not seem quality for an retailer piece.  this went back. I was very disappointed with my recent retailer order. i ordered the meleri eyelet tank and it had a stain on the front. i also order a dress that came with a tear in the fabric. sale items should not be damaged unless the customer is aware of the damage and accepts it in that condition. very disappointing. Overall nice material and styling but be prepare for it to be huge. i purposely sized down and i still felt like i was swimming in this. I purchased this top in blue and liked it so i ordered the red color. i hated the way the second one fit. i\\'m concerned the blue will not wear well after seeing the way the second one looked! The picture makes the pants appear flattering and comfortable. but they are not flattering at all. they seemed much bigger than they should have been and the \"fold over\" portion was not necessary. This shirt was on sale, and it was a good price. that is where the goods ended... the shirt was not flattering. i sent it back asap! I purchased this top in a size s. it is lovely but way too wide. i am 5\\'8\" and 140 lbs. so it\\'s unusual for me to have to size down to an xs. i am going to see if sizing down helps, but i am worried it will still be too wide. the fabric seemed of high quality and i loved the faded color so i am going to give it another chance. Very unflattering and no shape or flair. lots of extra material but no swing or shape. do not recommend. Beautiful top but the angles emphasized my widest fluffy bits in an unattractive way. i ordered size large. the material, fabric and lace are pretty and well done. my arms looked huge too. and the piece under the arm hit below my bra and it was clearly visible by a couple inches. i carry my weight in my mid section and am short waisted. think this would look best on taller, thinner bods. I was surprised at how soft this is. it also has snaps under each arm for definition, and on front for closure. didn\\'t know that, and love it. got yesterday in mail, wore out last night. highly recommend. This is huge. i thought it would be oversize but with a bit of shape. there is no shape to this and is a lot of material. i ordered an xs and typically wear an xs or s in blouses, sometimes medium in sweaters.\\r\\nit seamed like 2 sizes too big. the material is very soft and the collar is nice. there is a ribbon tie at the waist. the tie is wimpy and could be nicer. when tied, there is so much fabric the is gathers and looks like i have no waist. This dress is not what i expected. the bottom half is wool-like material-looks like someone has worn it. the top snags easily so you must be careful when wearing jewelry. when i received the dress i noticed there were two small holes under the arms. i wouldn\\'t of paid full price but for the amount, i sewed up the holes and packed it away for winter. This is a unique color, and a lovely dress. i have the yellow, and i didn\\'t find that it ran large. it definitely has a loose, flowing fit, and you can wear with or without a belt for different looks. the pleated fabric near the waist does fit differently than the other fabrics, but i don\\'t think it looks odd. you have several pictures of people wearing them, and you can see that it looks amazing on everyone! Oh elevenses, i love your pants..the fabrics, the details, the length. i\\'ve found elevenses to be classic work pants. reliable, professional, well made. these are none of those things. the cardinal trousers are thin and the rise feels much higher that\\'s it appears in the picture. the red pair are thin, stretchy and cheap. both pairs have to go back. i\\'m truly sad. As the other reviewer stated the dress is not lined and the fabric feels very cheap. i tried the sp as well and felt i could have gone down to the xsp. i like the style and coloring but given the price and lack of quality this is going back. I received this product and love the color and sheen of it. it is not too flashy, and would work great as a dress to an event day or night with the right accessories. i am about 5\\'7 and 115 lbs, and usually wear a size 0 in dresses. the size 0 fit, but was a little loose. if they had a 00 it probably would have been too small though. you definitely cannot bend over in this dress because it is too short, but i didn\\'t feel it was inappropriately short otherwise. it flares out just slightly on the I really wanted to love it but it was way too maternity on me. i love flowy but the flow on this dress hit me in all the wrong places. but i must say i have a 34ddd bust and wear a medium regularly. well i sized down and ordered a small and it just didn\\'t work. it just flowed right off my chest to what looked like a dress concealing a baby bump. overall its cute just not for me. I thought this would be a cute business attire skirt. i hate to say it, but i felt like it flared out as if i were amelia bedelia or some whacky children\\'s book character and not retailer. the fabric made it look bulky. i sadly had to return it. I really wanted to love this top. love the mix of fabrics and patterns. but it is too short for a tunic length. i should have paid attention to other reviews. i\\'m about 5\\'8\\'\\' and was not too tight in the bust and shoulders.i have to return because the length isn\\'t right. These shorts are comfortable and are just the right length. i have the blue and it isn\\'t as bright as shown in the pictures, but it\\'s a great color nonetheless that coordinates well with many wardrobe items. when i tried on my usual 25, i found the waist fit a bit snug so i bought the 26 for a comfortable fit. i should\\'ve stayed with my usual size though, because after wearing for an entire day, the shorts loosened up quite a bit and developed a saggy look to them. i\\'m so disappointed with this I was originally looking for a denim skirt with a fit and flare shape. i then saw this skirt and decided it was much more versatile than denim. it is a mid weight skirt, lined, good length...just above the knee, and the swingy shape is perfect. i will wear it now with boots and a chunky sweater. when it warms up, flats and a short sleeve sweater will be cute! i ordered a small, but i really should have paid more attention to the other reviews because it does run large! i ordered another one in e This runs sooo big! i normally wear a large ( 145lb, 5\\'-4\", 36dd) but due to the limited sizing small or medium i chose small because it looked big on the model and this style of dress seem to run large. the size small that i ordered couldve fit two people easily together! i loved the pattern, color and the slip underneath actually fit well but i dont want to look like im wearing a tent, lol. also, the back is slightly longer than the front, something i couldnt see from the pictures online. Comfortable casual, hip. i have the black & white color which is a bit thicker than the other colors which i prefer as i recently had a baby and need a little extra fabric. i wish the fabric was a bit softer but the cut is so flattering there was no way i was sending it back. i wish the other colors were in the same thicker fabric and i would have ordered more. my new go to top. the black ribbon on the back is my favorite part. Really wanted to like this top. the model has it on backwards - the \"v\" is actually the back and closes with an eye hook (that is where the tag is ? there\\'s also a seam running down the back). the front is actually a high round neck. the material has a metallic thread and felt rather scratchy cheap. i\\'m usually a s or xs. in this top the s had too much material at the bottom and flared out strangely. the xs was too short in the front and moving your arms caused it to ride up. Wow was this top huge on me! i am usually a large, but lean towards xl when things don\\'t have stretch. i sized up out of fear that my bust couldn\\'t squeeze into a large (36dd) and i didn\\'t want the buttons in the back to gape. when i took this out of the package (i purchased the blue) i knew right away it was way too big. looked like it could fit my husband. the sides poofed out so far, i looked ridiculous (if you look at the photos, the model is trying very hard to control the poofiness with he I was very excited about this product. when i saw it the pattern was beautiful in the romantic floral and the bottom band looked like the bathing suit was a little longer so i felt it would be good for a large chest. when i received the package i knew instantly it ran small. i tried it on and it barely covered half of my chest. also the band at the bottom is actually very small and not what i expected. the print is just as lovely in person as it is online. i don\\'t even know if sizing up will mak I purchased this dress to wear to a beach wedding. i loved the color, the fit and the style. i even got a lot of compliments on it. the problem was that the wedding was on the beach, in florida 85 degree weather and when you are sweating the fabric changes colors and takes a really really long time to return to normal! unfortunately i had to return it. would be great to wear indoors, just watch getting water or anything else on it! A lovely skirt and i\\'m so glad i found it before the medium sold out! having said that, i expected the medium to run small and that i\\'d have to squeeze into it but having tried it on this evening it\\'s not the case at all. i nice fit. i might even have fitted into a small, which i think is the only size remaining. the skirt is very spain inspired. very flamenco! i love it! i will say that you\\'d need a bit of height to wear this skirt due to the length at the back. i\\'m 5\\'6\" which is tall enough fo This top was way too short (i\\'m only 5\\'1) and way too wide. the cut of this top was so wide, it looked like a tent on me. i really wanted to love this top because the material and style (sleeves, ruffle) are beautiful, unfortunately there is something wrong with the cut. i\\'ve have several blouses made by one fine day, which fit nicely, for some reason this top did not. i ordered in my usual s size, even going to an xs would not work because the cut is wrong. I bought this sweater in dark grey in the store. i really loved it at first - it\\'s very soft and cozy and fits really well. i especially like that it\\'s long enough to cover my tummy and butt when i wear skinny jeans or leggings. however, the other reviews that mention it gets fuzz all over the place are accurate. i doubt i would have bought this if i had read them first. it even has dark grey fuzz in the inside of the sleeves. however, my biggest disappointment is that after just one wearing, th Had high hopes for this seemingly cute skirt to use as a basic in my spring and summer outfits. however, that was not the case. this skirt is not lined and the material is so so. basically, for the price, i was underwhelmed and will return it. I loved this t-shirt when i first tried it on: a good cut--not too drapey or fitted. but then i washed it (laid flat to dry) and it shrunk so much that it\\'s unwearable now. so disappointing. I order the blue and orange endora wing dress in an xxs and it was still very large. i know that this is a flow dress but there was so much excess material that i looked like i was swallowed. the colors are more muted than in the pictures, a faded blue and orange that i didn\\'t really like. return. I bought this in size xl. it ran much shorter & smaller than is typical for this brand. i found the arms tighter on me compared to the model\\'s photos. the lace itself was pretty, intricate and washed well. i wish this shirt had worked but i ended up donating it after wearing it a couple times. the cropped length and close-fit just didn\\'t work on me. i thought the sleeve shape was pretty. with just a little more material, this would have been a favorite. i hope it works well on whoever receives i I really love this camisole, but it\\'s shorter than i expected. This is such a beautiful top with pretty, vivid colors and soft fabric but the execution is wrong. the front is fine, the smocked upper portion is very flattering but then you turn around and the back fits like a cape. there is a ton of fabric especially in the upper portion of the shoulders and upper back, with pleats that begin under the ruffled neck and billow out. i got an xxsp (5\\'  103 lbs) so couldn\\'t size down. please retailer no more billowy tops!!\\r\\nso sad to have to return this one. The fabric is so soft, but it was too roomy in the top and miid-section so it didn\\'t flatter my body. I am of average height, but these pants are so long!! i considered altering them because i like the print, but i don\\'t think it\\'s worth the effort for workout attire so they\\'re going back. shame!! I would not recommend these pants if you have a curvy or athletic figure. these pants seem to be cut straight up and down. the fabric is not soft, the color is slightly more muted in person, and they are not as relaxed as they appear to be on the model. This looked really pretty but i think i am just too short for it. a little on the wider side. would look good on someone taller This picture does not do this blouse justice. the material is velour where the flowers are and there\\'s a bit of sparkle. i\\'m generally a pl in other stores and bought a m and was pleased. it\\'s true to size. i\\'m 5\\'1\" and the regular length was perfect and not too long at all. i won\\'t have to shorten it. the blouse will look great with skinny jeans and boots or the right long flowy skirt. it can easily be worn to a dressy occasion. it\\'s gorgeous!! The top looks like an oversized shirt in the model photo but as you can see it\\'s not at all in person. made with what feels like hospital scrubs-meets-crisp-poplin, this shirt is stiff and does not lay flat against the body. the cut is almost triangular or bell shaped causing it to jut out - think of a flared wide leg pant - but as a shirt. the sleeves have a similar cut as well. i, too, am a 34c and found it made me look much wider as your bust will cause the shirt to move away from you. it\\'s s I loved this top from the first time i saw it online. i ordered a size 10 ~i\\'m slim with broad shoulder & 36c~ the top fit perfect. when i opened the pkg i thought it would be too big since it looked wide but that was not the case at all. its a little longer in the back & a little shorter in the front. on me~it looks exactly like it does in the picture.its really a cute top & it looks lovely over shorts. makes a cute, casual summer outfit. i cant wait to wear it. I like the fabric - very smooth and feels nice on the skin. i like the handkerchief hemline too.i didn\\'t realize how much i would not like the neckline. it feels too tight and too high to me and i\\'m not sure i could wear this for long without pulling at the neck. also, the fit is loose, maybe a bit too loose for my taste. but it\\'s the neck fit that makes me have to return this dress. Beautiful fabric with soft drape. unfortunately the \"captain kangaroo\" pockets are awful. unless you have a straight up and down shape with no hips this is very unflattering. the pockets look like saddle bags and add a huge amount of fabric where most people don\\'t want added bulk. very disappointing. returned. This was completely different than i expected. the xs/s was so large that it looked messy. unfortunately i had to return it. Had to return. ordered an xs which usually fits perfect. 34b chest and it was falling off. shoulders and chest!! it was like a sleeping bag. huge fan of retailer but there is a design flaw in this sweater. The hemline on this is somewhat see through and that makes this denim skirt really stylish. the waist runs small so i had to return my size for the next size up which was still a bit snug. but the skirt is so far beyond the normal, ho-hum denim skirt i just have to keep it. at 5\\'3\" it hits just right, slightly above the knee. Yummy, soft material, but very faded looking. so much so that i am sending it back. if a faded look is something you like, then this is for you. The first time i wore this tank it started pilling around the arms and down the sides. it is terribly quality, and gets worse with every wear and wash. possibly the worst wear on a new clothing item i\\'ve ever seen. like the design and fit, immediately relegated it to a weekend/home shirt because it was unprofessionally pilly and the pills are small so can\\'t be shaved off. I assumed at the price point this would be a high quality t-shirt/sweater. unfortunately, it is made of cheap looking material that is 50% acrylic and see-through. I loved these pants the minute i put them on, and was so happy i\\'d ordered them. but i wore them only 3 times - and only at dinners with friends, not even for full days - and the seams on both legs ripped open! i think the faux leather just isn\\'t equipped to handle the stretch of fitted leggings. i was super-bummed about this, because these pants are so insanely cute. but if they can\\'t hold up to a few casual wears, then there\\'s just no way... thankfully retailer was true to their brilliant custom This pair of flare is just what i have been searching for. the color is a nice vintage blue. i love the fit of the flare however please keep in mind these do run long and larger that size. Love this top! pretty details and true to size fit! So bummed. i was really hoping this top would work for me. i got the black in regular size 4 and the pink in petite size 4. both hit my breast too high and were too bulky in the mid section. i have a sort of short torso, wear a small 34c, and am have a defined waist. when tops are bulky, it gives me no shape and just looks terrible. i am having the hardest time finding pretty tops that suit my figure. they did not lie flat like on the model but had so much extra fabric they stuck out.\\nthe constr I wore this tee under a comfy cardigan on a flight to denver. i received several compliments. I have several pairs of coh and love them all. when i saw these go on sale in my size i quickly purchased them. however, when i tried them on at home and looked in the mirror, i was pretty shocked that the back pockets were extremely long. meaning, they go well below your butt cheeks (like 3\"# which means they look like they are sitting too low on your body-and they aren\\'t they are actually i little higher waisted than most coh! \\r\\n\\r\\ni thought perhaps it was my perception that day, so i waited an The top was very small. i am usually a size small but this was tight around the top, arm holes and it was short. also i didn\\'t notice if it said it was sheer ( see through) in the description but it definitely requires another shirt underneath. I am a size 2 and the skirt fit however it is so thick and voluminous, it looked like a pirate sack. it\\'s unfortunately going back. This is a really cute shirt. i love the design, color and everything about this shirt but the size. i am 5\\'1 and 105 lbs, i can usually wear an xs or xsp. the xs was huge and they were sold out of smaller sizes or i would have ordered one. this unfortunately had to go back. Had to return this for a couple of reasons: 1) was too small! it\\'s made like one of those tiny mittens that stretches to fit any size hand. i didn\\'t bother to order a size up because i wasn\\'t sure whether to go from a small to a medium or to a large. 2) the main color isn\\'t grey, like the picture. it\\'s a black and white checkered pattern. so, it doesn\\'t look at all grey irl.\\r\\n\\r\\ni\\'m still recommending because, if you get the right size, and like the colors, it will be a nice, light and comfy swea Love this dress!  i sized up from a 6 to an 8 because of the small bust issue and it fits perfect.  perfect casual summer dress with a vintage feel. Cut out design, no seems or hems.\\r\\n very disappointed in retailer Oh dear. the elastic waistband just ruined this skirt for me--it made it look so cheap. i assumed from the photograph that the skirt was a knit over a structured lining with a real waistband with a zip. instead, it\\'s a sweatshirt knit with no lining and elastic. it looked cheap and hung a bit baggy from the elastic waist, making it a no-go for me. I received this shirt in my typical xs and it fits perfectly. i?m not crazy in love with it but i also don?t dislike. the shirt is on the thin side. do i need to wear a cami underneath it, no. my concern is holes. it does remind me of a material that could develop some holes after some wear and washes. with that being said i?ll wash this shirt in cold water and hang dry and hopefully that will prevent holes from developing. the length is fine and i do like the slits in front?it adds a little dim This is cute! i\\'ve been so looking forward to it, but it\\'s big!! i\\'m usually a small in retailer size, medium most of the time otherwise. i ordered the medium, but it\\'s way too big. doesn\\'t fit at all like the pictures. sadly, it\\'s going back, hopefully for a much smaller size. but other than this, it\\'s lovely Soft material, lays nicely. got an xs but usually wear a smaill. got it in the mail and it is wrinkly so will need to steam it. I ordered a size xl in the pink version with the multi-colored fabric. the fit is true to size other than the length. it isn\\'t 27 inches. it\\'s the petite length even though i ordered the regular sizing. i ordered a 2nd one and again, the length was around 25 in. instead of 27. so, it will be more of a swingy, shorter top than shown. but, through the arms/body, it\\'s true-to-size. i\\'ll be dry-cleaning this so it won\\'t shrink since i need the length.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe colors and embroidery are exactly as pict Bought this on sale and wore it to work yesterday with black skinny pants and leopard flats with a big gold necklace. i\\'m busty and have to be careful with peplum styles, but this one does well. Shorts don\\'t fit me like they did the first time and i\\'ve only worn them twice! the material isn\\'t what is use to be. it stretches out to fast. i don\\'t think i will be buying these again. wish i could take them back. Very cute dress! 5\\'4, 120 lbs - xs regular was too long, xs petite was perfect length! I bought these on sale and they quickly went back. i was very disappointed after reading the reviews. i thought for sure these would be a winner. however, i was sadly mistaken. i ordered another pair of jeans, the same, from a different brand. these were way too small while my others were too large. they didn\\'t live up to my expectation and were still rather long. even though i bought these on sale, i was not happy with the quality. This floral tank looks so cute on. the layered cut is very flattering and i\\'ve received several compliments while wearing it. adorable I was very excited when this dress arrived in the mail. the fabric is so comfortable, but the print was overwhelming. it is also very tight on the top and i got lost in the fabric at the bottom. i had to return it. I was drawn to this sweater for its vibrant colours and unique pattern. i tried it on and immediately fell in love with the comfort, quality, and design. it is a little short, but this minor issue is easily fixed with by wearing a neutral colored undershirt/camisole. the cuffed sleeves reveal a matching pattern and can be rolled down or up. i usually wear a xs or s in retailer\\'s clothes, but i sized up to a m on this one. definitely worth it. this is a festive winter piece that can be dressed up o Gorgeous sleeves, flattering neckline...and a voluminous torso. i loved the fit of the top portion so much, i decided to buy it, knowing it would require alteration. the seamstress removed a *significant* amount of bulk and added vintage buttons to clasp the inverted pleat. i find many of these \"easy breezy\" tops create a shapeless look. extra volume in both the front and back creates a needlessly rotund profile. despite excellent posture, i looked both hunched and pregnant in the unaltered silh Despite the fact that this jacket is made from a gorgeous ottoman looking knit fabric, and has perfect fit, nice arm length, looks good on the hanger, the jacket did me no justice at all. it arrived folded, in the mail, so i had to press down the unruly pleats before i could try it on (you have to do this with nearly every item you buy online that comes folded flat and stuck in a cellophane bag.). so i pressed the jacket, tried to neaten the pleats but to no avail. the pleats would not stay put I\\'m returning this cardigan. it doesn\\'t fit me at all. it\\'s shapeless and loose. Gorgeous dress, but so low in front and in back...i couldn\\'t figure out how to pull it off without a cardigan/sweater. beautiful fabric and color. This fell apart after wearing it once. for the price, it should hold up better. it\\'s too delicate. This dress is my personal introduction to talented indian designer, ranna gill. i just love this gorgeous, free- spirited dress! i bought the regular medium for my 5\\'1\", 34f, size 8 figure. it works very well. i will want to wear a black cami, as i\\'m not comfortable with some cleavage showing (maybe 3/4\") and the open lines of lacy, small holes down the front and back. you might not mind showing more skin though and not need a cami. the top is not very see-through, and the skirt is lined. the re Too much of a good thing is...still too much. there\\'s too much flounce on this jacket for me--the waist sits slightly high, and the incredible amount of fabric beneath it (when you twill around, it\\'s basically a full circle) makes my hips look huge. if there were about 1/3rd (not 1/2, but 1/3) the amount of fabric to the skirt, i\\'d be totally in love. \\r\\nas it is, i\\'ll be returning it. When i tried this top on, i started laughing. the two rows of ruffles are made of a starchy thick cotton, which, instead of falling by the hips, juts out like wings. it\\'s also huge. cute idea, wrong material and placement. ...the print is so sharking, and i love the way it looks on the model -- but i\\'m a more curvy figure, and the boxy-ish cut plus rather stuff fabric in front is incredibly unflattering. ordinarily i love everything made by maeve, but this one sadly must be returned... on a thinner/straighter-shaped person i expect it would be great. Wow this is huge! i\\'m all for the tent-look with the right style, but this was absurd. i could have fit two of me into the width, and with the peplum style, extra width doesn\\'t flatter anyone. the fabric is also so thin that it doesn\\'t hang nicely, it kind of floats around the body. if you want a wide top, then this is perfect, but if you wanted something that hangs nicely, look elsewhere. i purchased a petite s, my typical size. I bought this (because it looks beautiful, is well made, and a high quality piece). when i got it home and tried it on, it did not achieve the look i was going for (boho). instead, it was very drapery and full and big and i felt like i was wearing a ghost costume on halloween. i do love retailer\\'s kimonos and thought i\\'d love this one. but it\\'s going back. i don\\'t need any more clothes in my closet that i do not absolutely love and want to wear again and again. that is my new criteria for purchasi This is an awesome tank top, comfortable, great fit, casual but with ruffles a bit dressier than an ordinary tank top. i loved it so much i came back and bought it in the cream color. this runs a bit larger and i typically take an extra large but bought this in large and its perfect. Only the xxs was left, so i was a little concerned that it might be too small. not the case at all thanks to the very functional adjustable straps & high quality of craftsmanship & design. for reference, i\\'m 32c, 5\\'2 110-115lbs - kind off petite w/an athletic build. the black is lovely classic. the color, along with the beautiful design give this a timeless classic french look. very comfortable, too. love so much i, ordering more! I really wanted to love this dress.... \\r\\n\\r\\ni absolutely love the fabric and the bottom of it. sadly, the top was just too \"balloon like\" and poofed out way too much. i tried putting a belt with it which helped a little bit. if the top had been just a little more fitted this would be awesome. i don\\'t know if a smaller size would have helped the issue... i ordered a small and considered an xs but in the end just returned it. I loved the multi stripe pattern, buttons, pockets and a-line shape .  i agree it runs small. i sized up from my normal size 4 to size 6.  it sits at my belly button which i like.  i can tuck in a thin shirt comfortably.  the pockets kind of sag/pooch forward and don\\'t lie straight through the course of the day but not enough to really bother me.  i  straighten the skirt by pulling up.  great buy on sale. i\\'m 5\\'2\", 115#. This green dress seemed more fitted and tailored on the model. i ordered a small and medium in the green and mint (even though it says mint, it\\'s a grayish blue). usually i\\'m a medium but even the small seems a bit big. it fits more like a loose boho dress rather than how the model wears it. the colors are vibrant and the embroidery is nice. i will be keeping both colors in small and just have to accept that the fit is similar to a looser casual summer dress. if you look at the pics that other c I tried this in my normal sp. i found it to run a little snug, but the neckline was way too low for every-day wear. The tie jacket is an easy one to throw on for a casual look. it fits well to the body even better than pictured. very comfortable and medium weight so perfect for spring. Really wanted to luv this top buttt it ran small in arm length & in the front, bottom...backside was perfect coverage...also most important this top is see-through! item as pictured is not accurate! This is not even a dolman style sweater because it\\'s loose fitting everywhere around the arm. the point of a dolman sweater is that the sleeves are fitted around the wrist/forearm, but this is not the case with this sweater. it\\'s super loose around the wrist area - i can fit both of my wrists into a sleeve. I really loved the way this shirt looked on me. it\\'s forgiving and flattering, and really lightweight. the fabric, however, couldn\\'t even withstand half a day\\'s wear without snagging 3 times and developing a hole right in the center. i have no idea how this happened, as i wasn\\'t wearing or near anything that could have pulled at it. \\r\\n\\r\\nsuch a shame. this could have been a staple wardrobe piece for me. I love this dress. i purchased a size down from my normal dress size after reading the reviews. i\\'m 5\\'9\" 148lbs 34dd and the size 6 fit perfect. the attached slip is a tad darker than my  very fair skin color but it still works. can\\'t wait to dress it up with some nice heels. After the second wash, the stitching in the armpits completely fell apart. after sewing it back up, wearing it, and washing it a third time, the stitching in the other armpit completely fell apart as well. not sure if this was just a fluke, but it was very disappointing. now that both armpits are sewn and all other stitches are intact, i must say that this is a great dress. i would have returned the dress to retailer, but i\\'ve already washed and worn it, so again...very disappointing. i would say Do not waste your money on this.\\r\\nat first, i bought pilcro hyphen chinos short and i loved it. so i bought this pants in store too. i laundry them yesterday and they both came out colorless. i was so shock. \\r\\nfyi, i did not use bleach or chrolox, i mean i don\\'\\'t use them.i will return them both.\\r\\nstill mad. this is bad quality enough worth it. The print and front ruffle are beautiful. the sleeves are awful and poorly represented in the picture of the model. it\\'s almost like the sleeves have a life of their own - so mismatched with this style of blouse. such a beautiful print but so disappointing in shape. Ugh, the fit of this dress is terrible :/ what a beautiful dress though -- the material and the colors -- had so much potential. but, the fit is awful -- i ordered by regular size and the top was more or less ok, if not a tad big, but hip down was crazy tight that i couldn\\'t even zip it without a ton of effort. i don\\'t think sizing up will help because then the top will be even bigger. disappointing. I ordered top and pants online as seen. pants are of good quality and hang beautiful.  i love the color and quality of the fabric. nice and vibrant. nice fit at the top into a flowy drape. the top runs big and glad i ordered down one size. love the outfit for my upcoming island trip. These pants are gorgeous when you first see them. they fit beautifully when you first put them on. and then you wear them for one day. and they snag. on everything. and little strings start to come out of the pants. and the hem begins to unravel. and the pants which were once beautiful light summer pants appropriate for work or brunch are now frumpy, worn out pants with a million snags and strings hanging off of them .... after one day. \\r\\n\\r\\ni can\\'t begin to tell you how annoyed i am that i spent This is another one of those darned swing tops. i can\\'t even with this trend. this shirt has such a nice print/color palette going on but it\\'s ruined by the swing cut/henley combo- it looked like i was a little kid wearing an oversized men\\'s night shirt/smock? i don\\'t know, it was just not at all flattering. i ordered my regular size large and a medium would have worked and probably still been generously cut. i disagree with a reviewer who said it might work for larger sizes.. this just made my This was a rare full-price purchase for me. i do think that it runs slightly large, but that is part of the \"look\" of this dress. i considered sizing down to an xs for more definition at the waist, but they didn\\'t have one in store so i decided to stick with my regular s. i look forward to wearing this with sandals while summer is still sweltering, but i also think it will transition well with tights, boots, and a cardigan when temps start cooling off. I purchased the moss color in this cardigan. i really love the texture of the material. it is very very soft. my issue with this is the arms. like other reviewers have said they are extremely small! i went up to a large rather than my usual medium and they were still tight. i really wanted this to work but i will probably return due to the arms. I love this dress. the fabric is creative...checked lace. the silhouette is figure flattering. work appropriate and can wear it for dinner with a change of shoes and jewelry. I\\'ve been shopping at retailer since 2007, and floreat used to be my favorite designer, but for the past year or more, floreat mostly misses the mark. this blouse looks nothing like it does on the model. \\r\\n1. it is long on her, not so in real life. this is probably the worst part about this blouse. if it were not for this, i might try on a size m and give it another chance.\\r\\n2. it runs very large. i usually take a l or xl. i think i would need a m in this, as mentioned above.\\r\\n3. in the picture, t Super itchy! had to return. Love the design of the fabric. i actually bought these in both colors. i gave only 1 star due stitching on the fabric, it\\'s very scratchy. I love jeans!!! especially this pair. perfect fit, hugs in all the right places. perfect length! worn it 3x already! and it gets better every time you wear it. goes great with a cute too! I tried this dress on in store. i loved it online, but in person....not so much. it looked and felt like a cheap halloween costume. the fabric was bad. really bad.. the mustard color was beautiful.... boo The fit on this is so strange. the middle string is definitely too long and the thin halter top offers hardly any lift. the print is lovely and the quality nice for the price. the cups are padded, which is nice i suppose, but would barely cover anything bigger than a c cup i\\'m guessing. i\\'m a 32dd, size 8 in pants, and size 4/6 in dresses and i ordered a medium. i also have a long torso, which probably didn\\'t help. I love this dress and had so hoped to wear it to a wedding in june. the fabric is a perfect weight, very nice cotton, i only wish i could have kept it. i am 5\\'3\", 133 lbs and usually wear a size 6 which is what i ordered. it was fine in the skirt but the top was at least a size if not two sizes too small for 32 chest. i did not want to wear it open with a tee and so had to send it back. the wedding date does not allow for the new available date for the dress. This dress is really good quality and the beading is adorable. but, the sleeves combined with the maxi skirt made me look like i was a sister wife and not in a $250 dress. i still gave it four stars though, because i am having it hemmed to above the knee because i like the top part so much. i ordered the 00p, am 5\\'1 110 lbs and the waist fit perfect, the skirt was about three inches above my ankles. perhaps someone with a more boho style might find the length of the skirt cute but i just found i Great addition to my cold weather wardrobe! comfortable and has the slouchy look, but still nice enough to wear to work. It took me a while to finally try this on after seeing it in store for a while, i wasn\\'t sure about the color. then i saw it matched with the brush stroke charlie trousers (which i had just purchased) and loved the combination so much i had to finally try it. i love the fit and feel of this top. i agree with a poster before that the photo does not do this top justice. my only wish is that t was a touch longer. I wanted this jacket to fit on me like in the photo, but i guess my frame was still to petite. the fabric was also on the cheap end I recently purchased this blouse on their 40% off sale in white. i was hoping for a crisp white structured blouse. i did read all the reviews and thought i would give it a try anyway. it is awful. there is no structure or shape but the quality is the reason i am returning. it feels like a napkin or thinner. not even worth the extra sale price. i will be returning. These are cute...nice overall fit (tts) and length was like model on my 5\\'7\" frame...quality and comfort were also nice. for me the issue was color...when they came in at first i did a double-take wondering what i had ordered and if it was the right item. the colors are very bright, most notably an almost neon orange. the colors plus the diagonal lines/blue hem combo felt a little clown-like to me. i try to pick versatile items that i can wear multiple ways, and i just couldn\\'t imagine many ways This is beautiful tunic for the spring and summer. great paired with jeans or white denim. runs large and is a true tunic length. very pretty fabric and built in camisole, too. only downside is that it probably needs to be hand washed/line dried to keep it looking like new. I tell everyone i know to try these jeans, that they are so worth the price tag. i\\'ve been an ag super fan for years, but i fell in love with paige the moment i tried these on. (i still love ag for their colored and patterned ankle denim and cords.) i have worn these over 50 times without ever having to wash them. (i never understood the idea that you\\'re not supposed to wash denim, but now i realize that it\\'s feasible.) they don\\'t stretch out and still hug me like a second skin - without feeling Love this so much. it\\'s beautiful and i get tons of compliments. it\\'s a touch short as a dress but looks amazing with leggings! I absolutely love the fit and look of these jeans. i am 5\\'4\" and they fit perfectly. but oh my....the smell! it\\'s like burnt chemicals. i don\\'t know if it\\'s just this pair, or a problem with this dye in general. any one find any solution to this? doesnt seem to go away with washing. may have to return these jeans if i can\\'t get rid of the smell. :( Wow this is huge! i\\'m all for the tent-look with the right style, but this was absurd. i could have fit two of me into the width, and with the peplum style, extra width doesn\\'t flatter anyone. the fabric is also so thin that it doesn\\'t hang nicely, it kind of floats around the body. if you want a wide top, then this is perfect, but if you wanted something that hangs nicely, look elsewhere. i purchased a petite s, my typical size. Wanted a jumpsuit that didn\\'t look stupid on a 50+ year old -- this is it! ordered a large and it is a little loose around the waist, but still fits and is comfortable. extremely well made and very cute. the only complaint is that it is difficult to tie the back. I tried these on because the color is really pretty and fun, and who donse\\'t want a pair of comfy/cute pants... but they looked awful on my muscular thighs... i don\\'t think the cut will be falttering on 99% of the population. also, not as comfortable as they looked, the crotch seemed a little \"low\" on me, though the pants were in the correct size. Highly recommend these jeans! they are ultra-soft and fit your body like a dream. the wash is flattering on them as well. i was looking for a pair of jeans to be my go to and ultimately landed on these. they do runa little big but they do not stretch out much so i went with my usual size. Beware. white is not white. white is more cream, off-white, light beige. i was really looking forward to these shorts but was immediately disappointed when i saw the color. they are cute, but not white. i bought them to wear with the nautical look tops for this summer, but unfortunately, creamy colored shorts don\\'t do much for navy/white tops.also, the button is very difficult to open/close.otherwise they are ok. I liked the design and the shirt did fit well enough, but the thin fabric does not justify the price. it looks like it will get holes in it after a wash or two. These run a tiny bit large, but i\\'m still keeping them. they are so soft and comfortable! Love marrakech for their jackets! this piece is wonderful! i usually wear an xs or s in this brand in jackets. i went with an xs as the sleeve are a little loose. the body still fits buttoned up- nice and tailored. the stretch keeps in comfy with the tailored fit in the trunk. looks great worn open too. i think the best part is the cut and material. i am 5 \\'4 and 125 lbs, curvy. Bought the tan/taupe joggers today in asheville. so soft and comfy, will probably go back for navy ones. i found them true to size. will be a great, cute addition to my summer wardrobe. Man, this dress is the worst. i don\\'t understand how it looks the way it does on the model. agree with previous reviewer - there must be a minimum of 200 pins pulling the waves and waves of extra fabric back. this dress looks so cute , but is so, so, so disappointing in person. sweater collar and cuffs - stiff and bulky. dress - billowy and sack-like - not sure how they got a belt to pull it all in. save yourself the return and do not get sucked in by the sale price and extra sale discount like Was looking more for a tailored, blazer like chino jacket. this was just too bulky. usually wear a 00p, ordered the 00, and could have put a chunky sweater underneath. 5\\'4\\'\\', 110 lbs, 32c for reference. The cut and color of the dress is awesome. however, the biggest flaw is the zipper. i only got to wear this dress once until the zipper broke..sad day especially at the price. there also were a number of loose threads. i recommend waiting until it goes on sale. you\\'ll want the extra money for a tailor to fix that zipper. This dress is very pretty, versatile and high quality! i\\'m planning to wear it to a wedding. with the holiday season coming up, i will definitely get to use it as well. the fabric is very comfortable especially the top part; it\\'s very soft. i usually wear an xs petite, this dress seems to be a liiiiiittle too long for me and the waist is a tiny bit too loose from how i like it but it\\'s manageable. (i have this dress in ivory top) Extremely disappointed with this top. it runs extremely large. i\\'m 5\\'2, 130 lbs, 34c and usually wear between a 0-2 & xs-s tops at retailer. i ordered a 0 and it looked like a maternity top on me. the bottom half of the top flared out and did not fit close to the body at all. fabric was also a gauze-like material that was not soft. unfortunately, i will be returning. I purchased these in a 26 petite and a 26 regular. the 26r was too long and bunched up terribly pass the knee. they were also loose in the waist and overall body. the 26p fit great in the waist and body, however; past the knee it was too tight and again it bunched but not as bad as the 26 reg. the overall quality of the jean seems fairly good. the fit just did not work for me so these go back and the hunt continues for white jeans. would love it if they made the hyphen jeans in white. I found this cardigan/sweater in the sale room at retailer in navy. thought i would just try it on. the picture does not do this justice. it is a basic piece but it is so soft and comfortable and when on, it has a little bit of a whimsical swing to it. i loved the way it kind of came to life. i wear a m/l and bought the m. i have a 36d bust and it looked great. it is a nice weight for spring/fall. it is not a heavy sweater. I took a chance on this top because i liked the style. i prefer natural fibers like cotton and linen. this is rayon and spandex. sure, why not at least give it a shot and go outside my box?! if the fabric would have been my preference, it would have been a keeper. i did not like the feel, nor the semi-sheer quality. maybe it would work for you, but not for me. back it went. Love this black and white dress. the bottom art print is so nice, i am a sucker for flowers, i also love the cut of it, teh tiered hem is very flatering, not too much amterial. the upper part covers a normal bra, and the whole dress is super flowey, substantial amterial, and stretchy (for those days where you ingest more than itnended). flattering cut (waist being the aame apttern as the bottom, gives it a nice shape). i can\\'t say anything bad about this. \\r\\n\\r\\nregular xs fit me but i would ahve t I saw the photo of the young woman wearing this dress in the reviews and she looked beautiful, i on the other hand looked awful. the fabric of the entire dress is quite stiff, so the dress didn\\'t move with me; it sort of felt as if i was wearing a paper cut out. then to contribute to the volume, the sleeve is not set in, it is a raglan style, that on me looked more like a bat suit, than what i was hoping for, a beautiful distinctive dress for an important affair. also the belt didn\\'t enhance the I thought this dress looked so cute and comfortable and was excited to try it on, and i was majorly disappointed. it was incredibly unflattering, in every way. as a few of the other reviewers mentioned, if you have any sort of bust the dress will not hang nicely, the waist band was too high up and made me look pregnant. i\\'m 5\\'2 and curvy and usually take a lg in retailer, but this...ewww! i will say the color and material are gorgeous, but i\\'m guessing this is the type of dress that would look bes Retailer consistently provides unique, sophisticated and quality made clothing. with the exception of an occasional purchase at their sister companies, i shop with them exclusively. i suppose that i can\\'t expect 100% perfection from retailer-but 99% of the time-that\\'s what i get. this is that 1%...this sweater is truly awful! i cannot (or find it very difficult at least) begin to describe what this sweater is like but it is so unlike retailer that, had it not been for the distinct pattern on the front This top looked positively vulgar on!!!! i am a 34d, and it was way too low cut...my boobs were spilling out!!! in addition, the fabric reminded me of a cheese cloth.....it just looked and felt cheap. unfortunately, this top will be going back. Loved this shirt but it runs pretty big. i\\'m normally a sm/med due to bust size (34ddd) and ordered a small based on other reviews. could have gotten an x-small. debating going to exchange. i ordered it in three colors bc it was on sale. better quality than some at retailer. I do love this dress. i wore it for my 20th anniversary party and received numerous compliments. it\\'s great for embracing your curves. it has a wonderful \"vintage-made-modern\" flair that classic retailer pieces always have. you do have to be careful when wearing it...jewelry or belts may snag the intricate lacework. i am definitely the type of shopper who waits for a sale. this is one of the few pieces i felt i could splurge on. it is just that unique. i hope that retailer continues to carry these t Love the red color. bought the small because left of center usually runs big. however, i could use m in this style. I really wanted to love this dress. i love the colors and the design of the dress. unfortunately, i have to agree with one of the other reviewers that this dress makes you look pregnant. it\\'s so voluminous that it\\'s not flattering at all. also agree that the lining is scratchy. Very beautiful colors unfortunately the cut is much too tent- like and it looks like a maternity top on me. i like a flowy bohemian top but this one was too much for my tastes, sadly i sent it back. I found this skirt beautiful for year round wearing.  it\\'s lined and tts.  i usually wear a size 4 and this fit well.  some might say it runs big but i like skirts to sit a bit lower on my waist and this gave me a good 2 inches in length.  i\\'m 5\\'3\" and 119# and it hit me just above the knee.  i paired it with the back tie embroidered top by akemi & kin because the blue of the embroidery in the shirt was beautiful with the blue in the skirt.  it will also go with a cropped creme turtleneck i have I saw tons of people raving about this piece so i had to check it out for myself. i love the vibrant colors and the design and while the fabric is delicate it feels amazing and light. i sadly had to leave it as the store as i am a girl with a larger chest and big hips. i looked huge and it was not flattering to my shape. if this dress came in a maxi with a high waist like i would be all over it. it is beautiful. I might be the only odd person out there who think this jacket is not perfect at all. a lot of other reviewers said that the jacket runs small. for me, it\\'s not true at all, i had to go to xxp petite to find the fit acceptable, but it was simply too short (rather than 20\" as it states on the website, it\\'s more like 18\"), which is a thing i almost never experienced because i am a petite person! i don\\'t even want to go regular size because it would\\'ve been too big. i saw some photos that others po The top on the model in the photo is a true ivory, but the top in reality is more beige. well, i\\'m blonde with fair skin, so i\\'m not sure this is going to work. it also looks more dressy in the photo than it does in reality -- i think the ivory color on the model and the pleats only down the front make it look more dressy -- but in reality, with it really being beige, having pleats everywhere, and being a crinkly fabric, it looks more casual. i had wanted it to be more dressy to pair with skirts This dress is beautiful. the fabric is light weight but textured and interesting, and the purple is gorgeous. the soft pink was a bit more orange than i expected, but not a deal breaker. the problem i had with the dress was fit around the arms. i sized up and was glad that i did because it runs small up top, but because the straps come in a bit around the arm holes, it creates armpit fat, which is not a problem i usually have. i could wear the dress with a sweater, but you wouldn\\'t be able to se The fabric and color are absolutely beautiful. the shape of the dress is strange - fitted and tight through the waist, and enormous everywhere else. it was not flattering. I was really eager to receive this sweater, i was expecting the same as in the picture. i received it today and i am already returning it. first of all the sweater didn\\'t look new, it is mostly shapeless, it has little balls and piling on the wool (what happens after wearing a sweater for a few months) and the metallic color makes it look cheap. in the knitting itself there are missing points and there are actual holes in some places. it is a beautiful design but other than that not even the col I ordered the skirt online and when it arrived i loved the fit and the aesthetic of the skirt. i usually wear a 0/2 bottoms and sized up based on comments- it fits great could maybe even have taken a 6 to have a looser fit.\\n\\ni was however very disappointed when receiving the skirt to see that the material was already highly snagged- how is that possible if coming directly from the warehouse? i\\'m hesitating to return because i consider it already damaged based on the current condition and if it\\'s As others have mentioned, they\\'re quite long. i\\'m 5\\'8\" and need to wear 2\" heels to make sure these don\\'t drag. they\\'re much tighter in the butt and thighs than my other pilco pants. i love the button detail at the ankles. I wanted these culottes to work so much! the fabric is gorgeous, but the size i ordered didn\\'t fit. i\\'m normally a size 28 in pants, and i ordered a size 8. it was way too tight and made me look like i had a pooch in the zipper area. not what i wanted it to be. had to return them unfortunately. Better than a regular boring cardigan. goes with short sleeves and dresses!! These are my first pilcro. love the tuxedo seam and notch at the side, and the noni green is a verstaile, yet unusual green. thicker soft cotton with just 3% spandex.\\n.\\nordered sizes 25, 26 and 27 regular which are a perfect full length for me. i\\'m 5\\'2\", currently 33-25-37, longwaisted and pear shape. i wear a 26 in ag stevie cords which are snug first, then stretch to a perfect size and often a size 27 in their less stretchy stevie jeans.\\n.\\nin these the 27 were so big at the waist that they sli The fabric felt cheap and i didn\\'t find it to be a flattering top. for reference i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are 38-30-40. I ordered this online and was completely underwhelmed in person. the pattern didn\\'t pop at all and the fit was just ok. it kind of bunched weird in the breast area. i usually love plenty but this is a return. This blouse is beautiful and i saw someone wearing it and she looked great. i went and bought this to wear for a holiday party and it is not for people with any sort of chest! it looked ridiculous on me as the pleats started right at the bra line and caused the blouse to tent out in both directions! however - looks super cute on those more on the flat-chested side! This is a beautiful shirt. the back is a few inches longer than the front which makes for a cool effect.\\r\\nthe only thing that i didn\\'t like about this shirt was how fragile the buttons on the back are. i was taking this shirt off and one popped off. when i went to hang it, another one popped off! so i had to return it. such a shame. Like one of the previous reviewers, when my jacket arrived, it was not in the great dark wash pictured online. it was in a basic, medium denim wash. i like the wash pictured online; i did not like the wash the jacket came in. additionally, know that it is just huge. i ordered my usual size (medium) and understood that the jacket was meant to be roomy and swingy, but there is no way that one size down would be enough to compensate for how swimmingly large it was. i never tried an xs, but it was s Looks lovely in the picture but looks poorly made in person, runs very small. i returned it. Wow was this top huge on me! i am usually a large, but lean towards xl when things don\\'t have stretch. i sized up out of fear that my bust couldn\\'t squeeze into a large (36dd) and i didn\\'t want the buttons in the back to gape. when i took this out of the package (i purchased the blue) i knew right away it was way too big. looked like it could fit my husband. the sides poofed out so far, i looked ridiculous (if you look at the photos, the model is trying very hard to control the poofiness with he I tried on a l and found it incredibly unflattering on a large chest, as the waist hits a bit high.\\r\\nthe color is vibrant...i wanted to like! I love the style of this dress and the way it lays. looks nice on, just wish it were longer. i normally wear size small but had to return for a medium so that it was long enough. I was very patient with this dress. i was waiting almost forever till this dress gets on sale. when i tried my usual 6 size it was way too tight but i could zip it. ( i am 5\\'6\\'\\' 145 lbs). the dress covers my knees and it\\'s a perfect length, so when i sit it does not show too much of my length so it\\'s a work friendly. it has side pockets, which can be very comfortable as well. the cut is great, it\\'s a line,the thickness of material makes belly look great (in case if you care). i also like color a This dress is comfortable and a great piece to travel with. goes with ballet flats, sandals, to ankle boots. I wouldn\\'t be so unhappy if these pants cost about 75% less. they are so cheaply constructed. one wash and they\\'re all but guaranteed to shrink. the material is so cheap and flimsy not at all what i expect from retailer. they are also 32 inch inseam not 35.5 as stated on the web site which is the whole reason i bought them. I almost ordered this online to wear to a party later this week, but i\\'m glad i waited to try it on at the store (i wasn\\'t sure if i\\'d like the length of the petite or regular better.) i was so disappointed and didn\\'t end up getting either! i have two bailey 44 dresses from several years ago that are much more flattering and incredibly soft/comfortable. this fabric on this dress was much rougher and it really bothered me that the stripes cut off at the side seams and then don\\'t match up from the These shorts work well for shopping, running errands, or spending hours on dirty baseball bleachers. they are not too short and are true to size. I wish i had read all the reviews before purchasing. the sweater looked liked everything i would be interested in online. once i pulled it out of the bag, my first thought was how could retailer send me a used, washed and shrunken sweater. it is nothing like the picture. it fits like a midriff top, not exaggerating. i\\'m 5.6, ordered the m, don\\'t waste your shipping money on this. Loved the look of the sweater and the the fit was as shown.  however this is a thin cashmere for the price.  returned. I agree with the other reviews, this top runs large so size down. with that being said, this is a beautiful top, love it! The fabric and color are absolutely beautiful. the shape of the dress is strange - fitted and tight through the waist, and enormous everywhere else. it was not flattering. I tried this shirt at my local retailer and absolutely loved it ...until i read dry clean only!!!\\r\\nreally retailer? i know you can do better than that... If you know the meghan trainor song (and who doesn\\'t?), you\\'ll know what i mean! i could tell by the photos online that this skirt would enhance curves, and i am fine with that. however, it is very snug in the rear. i can honestly say i had made it to my 40s without ever once wondering or worrying, \"does my butt look big in this?\"--that is, until i tried on this skirt. however, i chose to keep it since we were going to hawaii soon, and i decided it would be fine as a casual skirt and cover-up. i Absolutely love the jacket! wore it out in nyc at a rooftop bar and many people complimented on it. the faux fur is soft and pink color is beautiful. it is trendy but classy and can be worn dressy or dressed down with boyfriend jeans and booties. perfect transitional jacket from day to night =-) Purchased the xs blue. love the fit and light material. perfect casual tee for warm weather. no shrinkage after washing in cold water and minimal wrinkles when hung immediately. I loved this top... the color is true to screen. the cut is cute. it\\'s a lovely basic top that has just the right twist to it. i loved the fabric. it is see-through but if you wear a nude colored bra under it nothing shows. I was so disappointed with the quality of this dress, especially because it looks so beautiful on the model. the fabric was so thin that after one hand wash, it\\'s already developing a tiny hole and pilling. also, it is definitely not a \"day dress\"--i wore it as a swim coverup, but it is much too thin and pajama-like to be worn as an actual dress. the color is much different in person--the blue is brighter and, for lack of a better way to describe it, cheap looking. the white banding around the t This is a super cute, adorable and flattering maxi. it\\'s very comfortable and soft. i stayed tts in this dress... the length hit just right .. ...perfect for summer This dress has a flattering and fitted cut which perfectly compliments the unique eyelet fabric. it is at once elegant yet casual, perfect for the office or better yet, afternoon tea in a far flung british colony of yesteryear. which brings me to the buttons - putting on this dress makes one wish one had a ladies maid, but the effort is well worth it for this stunner of a dress. as others have said, it runs small and tight in the chest and is not for the well endowed. i am a petite 5\\'2\" and fit Very cute dress, but fabric is very flimsy and seams were very puckered which couldn\\'t be pressed out. I tried on and bought this shirt in my usual size and it fit long and loose but still had great shape. after hand washing in cold water and air drying, as per instructions on the tag, the shirt shrunk significantly. so much so that my stomach shows if i raise my arms at all. it also lost its shape, and now looks very boxy and is very unflattering. i won\\'t be wearing it and am disappointed i didn\\'t even get to wear it once! The cups on this suit are  ridiculous.  unless you are going to a nudist beach i do not recommend.  the construction of the suit itself was also vey poor. seams were messed up, a big pull right on the front-- i brought it back. sad because the design was adorable- just poor execution. This jumpsuit is absolutely fabulous. i normally don\\'t wear jumpsuit but i like this one very much. it can be dresse down or dressied up. i really recommend this to everyone any shape who have. very relaxing and beautiful. There are darts that are not shown in this picture that make the dress ill fitted. not sure why they are not in the picture and on the dress. i wish the pictures shown were more accurate. I wish i had read the reviews before purchasing online. i love how this top looks online but when i tried on the small that i ordered, it was comical. so so boxy. literally, shaped like a square. it must be pinned back on this model. maybe if i ordered an xxxxs it would have worked...or perhaps for a larger person, it may look super cute!\\njust didn\\'t work on my slim build. :( This dress immediately caught my eye in the store. the colors are vibrant and the cut is flattering. i wear a smaill and it fit perfectly, the sweater material is not thick so it can be worn all year. it is very versatile. This coat is beautiful in color and design. we could have been great friends but it was waaay too big so i had to return it. i bought the smallest size possible yet i could have been 9 months pregnant and still would have had room to spare. i also was disappointed that the sleeves were not lined like other coats in this price range. Fight a bit snug over the bust then widens like a bell. not as cute as it looks in the photo. returned. When i put this skirt on my aunt said that looks like a skirt with class. she\\'s right. this skirt feels as wonderful on as it looks. i love the faux leather slash, it is the perfect detail without detracting from a printed top. i think it is great to just slip on no zipper (for those days).i even pulled this on over a dress. bailey 44 hits it out of the park again. i have 3 dresses and now a skirt. t.e colors on the website are brighter than they are in person, just fyi. These have a great fit & design. i ordered a size larger after reading that this style runs on the small size. typically i\\'m a 27 but ordered a 28. the wash has a great vintage feel about it! i also love that these do not lose their shape after wearing all day. Too full of a dress for me. i tried a belt and it is then too chunky. if you are younger, tall and slim, this would look great This was my absolute favorite top before it transferred dye onto the driver\\'s seat in my car. >:-( there is nothing in the language of the care tag which advises to wash before wearing because of the possibility of dye transfer to other surfaces. the care instructions say that is is washable with like colors and, in fact, recommends dry cleaning. really? and dry cleaning will remove all of that excess dye? don\\'t think so. after i discovered the dye transfer on my car seat, i washed the top in a I returned this dress because the material is so flimsy and thin. i was expecting higher quality, especially for the price. i was disappointed. it is a pretty dress and fit great, but i felt like i was wearing tissue paper. The dress is pretty and like retailer it is nice quality, i just didn\\'t keep it because it had no shape on me and even with a belt didn\\'t look right. i would have gone down a size in this dress also. I absolutely loved these pants when i tried them on. i am 5\\'1 and will definitely need it hemmed because they are so so long. but i\\'m fine with that because these pants are so unique and gorgeous. i\\'m 130 lbs usually a size small but xs fit me just fine. i will have to say though, i am very upset because my pants shipped with a huge tear in the waistband. the only way i was able to try them on was because the last bit of the waistband was hanging on by a thread. so the quality isn\\'t too great. a I want to like and keep. at this price point i cant justify keeping. if it does go to clearance i will reorder. due to the thin material it seems more summery and casual than what i was anticipating. true to size. i ordered a medium and am 5\\'9 and 155 pounds. This top is crazy in the front and just way-off when it comes to a cross-over drape. the top did not lay flat and the drape over has one snap which seemed to \"bloop\" open constantly. the bottom in the front is a strange combination of layers that i couldn\\'t get to look good.\\n\\ni\\'m busty, but this isn\\'t the reason this blouse is just a disaster of a fit on me. the blouse fits tts and everything was covered, so it\\'s not like it was too small and tugged. that\\'s not the case. this blouse just didn\\'t I wanted to love it, but it\\'s pretty pricey for a sweatshirt & the key hole in the back with the bright pink ribbon just looks odd. the stitching & beaded detail around the bottom hem & the cuffs is gorgeous, but the sleeves were way too long on me and just looked silly. unfortunately this will be going back. Just a heads up because i didn\\'t notice the pink in the blue motif print until it had arrived. almost sent it back - changes the overall aesthetic, makes it harder to layer in winter, black shoes stand out more etc... but i don\\'t really like the orange print and i\\'m a red head... so i\\'m keeping it but it would have been amazing if it were cream and blue. i also bought the emerson swing dress. this dress runs tts (emerson runs a touch larger). i\\'m 5\\'5\" and the dress came to just barely above my k I found the fit of this dress odd. i typically wear a 6 or 8 in dresses. the 6 fit across the chest but the armholes were large so wearing a bra would be a challenge. i am a 34c so i need some type of support. i also thought the fabric was a bit flimsy for the price. i am a huge retailer fan and usually leave glowing reviews but sadly i left this one in the store. I love jumpsuits - except for this one. the fabric is blah. it\\'s between plastic and the material that they make flags out of. the print is adorable and the buttons up the front are super cute. the tie thing that\\'s just hanging there?  it\\'s a tie thing that just hangs there. it doesn\\'t  look good hanging, and it doesn\\'t look good tied.  this jumpsuit had so much potential. i\\'m definitely disappointed.  for sizing reference, i am 5\\'5\", 135, 34c and a small was perfect. It\\'s nice material but the design makes you look like a pregnant lady Good quality jeans, but had to return, as they did not fit my curvy hips. The fit was fine, but the fabric (the beige option) was bland. it washed me out. granted, i\\'m fair skinned, but it reminded me of sour milk. it\\'s getting returned. I agree with other reviews, soft, cozy and love the embroidery and beading. it is a bit wrinkly even after i ironed it but overall happy with this blouse. I ordered my usual size 8 but this run huge, i had to exchange for 6 or even size 4. the fabric is nice and airy. it seems to easily wrinkle though. just have to either iron everytime or dry clean i suppose. unique design. This shirt is thin and shapeless. the quality is h&m esque. unflattering. not a fan I love these pants! best fitting pants i\\'ve ever owned. flattering. stretchy/don\\'t stretch out. i am so sad that retailer didn\\'t plan well and stock enough. i bought the black, want the gray and all sizes but 25 and 31 are sold out. i might just buy another black pair so i can have another. i really wish retailer would re-stock these!!!! although these are 5star pants, i rated them a 3 for retailers poor / low stock quantity. Quality jumpsuit but poor design. the green made me look a bit like \"gumby the cartoon character\" These shorts are just beautiful. with that said, they were expensive, but made reasonable when i snagged them in the online sale! they do also run large, and they seem to be made for short-waisted bodies. i will be bringing them back to my local store to (hopefully) exchange for a smaller size. fingers crossed that they still have them in stock! This looks nothing like it does on the website. it runs small and the colors are so muddy. it doesn\\'t drape nicely and i a musually an xs and this was short, stiff and plain ugly. sent it back immediately. I\\'m 5\\'2 and 105 lbs; normally a size 25 petite for most jean brands but learned after receiving my online purchase that these jeans run large. i exchanged them for a size 24 petite and thought they fit okay at first but after testing them around the house, they kept stretching and i felt like they were going to fall off my waist! didn\\'t want to wear a belt with these because it distracted from the relaxed style. sadly had to return my purchase. I purchased this when it was on sale and it is a great, comfortable, and forgiving top. this top again runs a bit large, so i ordered a size down and it fits great. i think that they are off a bit on their description of the color. i ordered ?pink? but i would consider it more of an orangish red color. not my favorite but not terrible either. overall it is a great shirt. I love the look of this jacket. it\\'s incredibly soft and fits tts. i love how it\\'s a little different and fun. however, it\\'s already pilling after 3 wears. probably have gotten a total of 15 hours of wear out of it. i am so disappointed. for this price point, i would have expected better quality. I really love the color of this item. it is very generous in cut. i would suggest sizing down as i like my clothes more fitted. i received many compliments among my colleagues who wearing. I wanted to give this a try but unfortunately disappointed with the fit and styling. i\\'m 5\\'6\", petite build and it consumed my slim figure. i loved the soft and coziness and the color is sweet too. i just felt like an awkward butterfly with the sleeves. pinning them back would have been alright but the execution didn\\'t fit my frame. i would have liked it to be a tad longer too. i really hope they use this same material throughout the fall season because it\\'s so cozy. I wanted to get a couple tops for date nights that went well with skinny jeans and this hit the mark! as mentioned before, this top is translucent and thus would recommend using a cami as well. however the embroidery is beautiful. i have not had it cleaned yet and thus cannot comment on the durability. can\\'t wait to wear it out. It\\'s not a bad concept but i wished for more. i wish this tunic was a: different material as it was wrinkley and drop-waist design instead of at the waist. too bad. i wanted to love it but it will go back. When i saw this shirt, i knew i had to have it! i got the white with yellow flowers, and the pattern is perfectly charming. i\\'m 5\\'2\" and petite with a short torso. the petite xs fit me perfectly! the material is pretty thin, so i hope it stays in good shape. until then, i can\\'t wait to dress this up for work and dress it down for casual summer days. Im normally an xs and i bought size 2 and it fit great. very slimming and looks great with white capris. Quality jumpsuit but poor design. the green made me look a bit like \"gumby the cartoon character\" This jacket is perfect and drapes very well. i had my eye on it online and the second i put it on, it was a \"yes\". if you are between sizes, as one reviewer mentioned, size down. it\\'s tts but has a little extra room for me on the 2, so i sized down to 0. 5\\'4\" 115lbs. This dress overwhelmed me. i\\'m 5 feet tall and the print and material just took over. I loved this dress and was hoping to keep it. but, for an a-lign dress it was not roomy enough in the hips and the waist was baggy. i think this dress would look great on a very very slim build with straight hips. Love this dress! perfect length and i love the construction and where the seams hit (not too long, not too short). i got so many compliments with this dress! These pants are wonderful. they are very flattering, the color is gorgeous, and they are incredibly comfortable. got tons of complements! Weave on the sweater quite open and easily snags . the first day i wore it the seam on the sleeve began to unravel. needed to use a crochet hook to reweave after the first wearing. not confident that it will hold up well to its first wash. Lovely colors and print. my problem with this dress was that the bust was on the smaller side (it will fit those with a smaller chest nicely!), and worse, the beading on the bodice was attached with black thread, which showed through the sheer netting layer on top. \\r\\n\\r\\nfor the price, this particular detail should have been addressed. I was looking for a really warm, but stylish coat that i could wear when the weather is frigid as it sometimes gets here in the dc area. i tried on a size small, which is my usual coat size. while the coat fit, it was not flattering. for reference i am 5\\'9\" 128 pounds and usually wear a small/xsmall in retailer tops. in this coat i looked like a linebacker with pads on. the front material is doubled, which makes you look like you have a large protruding stomach. the shoulders are bulky and Cute and comfortable top. very cute top that i will have to wait a few months to wear (until it is cooler out), but a great piece to pick up for a nice price! it is soft and comfortable with a generous amount of room, but not where you look too big. i ordered it in the blue, but really it is like a dark gray ? which does not bother me. Poor quality, material looks much thinner and cheaper than pictured. I love these overalls  but they run very small?i had to return and reorder. I\\'m wearing lots of these long cardigans right now. this one is comfortable but holds up well. the blue color is a lovely wedgewood blue. the little tie detail on the back of the neck is cute, but doesn\\'t get in the way. it\\'s great for casual or casual work wear. The top is more of a cream color than an ivory. it\\'s also a bit boxer than anticipated. fit is true to size. This is a nice, heavy sweater for cold days and lounging in jeans. very comfortable and flattering. I love this robe and can\\'t wait to wear it while i\\'m getting ready for my upcoming wedding. the only con that i can see is that the sleeves are a bit baggy, but other than that it\\'s perfect! I so wanted to love this dress. i bought it in a size 4 and in both petite and regular, as i\\'m kind of in between and have a long torso and short legs. anyway, i\\'m 5\\'5\" tall and 130 lbs. the regular fit my torso well, and length not was too bad. with heals it might have worked without hemming. here is where it all fell apart. while understand that only really expensive designer clothing can afford to seam a pattern perfectly, i felt that the dot seam in the front of the dress was in a bad place. This dress is stunning.  it may be my new favorite thing!  i\\'m not sure where you are to wear this as it is really fancy but i will wear it to work and church anyways--even if it is a bit on the dressed up side.  the fit it true to size.  i am 5\\'8 and the length is similar to that on the model in the photo. zipper troubles!  i can zip it off of my body--but when one when it comes to the thicker part where the zipper is i cannot zip it--decided could zip halfway and still shimmy in. This denim dress is best worn by someone over 5\\' 8\". i had to spend a lot to have it taken up and it still doesn\\'t look that great. so if you don\\'t want to pay over $200 once altered, do not buy this dress.\\r\\n\\r\\nthe best part of the dress is the top. it was true to size on top. Being six feet tall, i\\'m always combing reviews for the opinions of other tall women, and i\\'m glad i did on this one! with the off the shoulder look, you can sometimes gain extra length, and it\\'s true in this case. i stayed tts because of length issues, and while it is billowy, it\\'s not horribly so. i would think, however, if you\\'re between sizes, or not worried about height, i\\'d go with the smaller option. adorable, comfy, casual while being dressy enough for a night out! I lucked out and found one of these in my local retailer and i absolutely love it. fits well, although, i do think that the sleeves run a tad bit narrow when they are folded up, but i prefer the dress with the sleeves down anyway. fits very true to size. i can\\'t wait to wear this with boots and leggings! Was in my local retailer today and just had to try this on! it appeared to be a structured jacket, but it is actually a sweater-jacket! gives a very \"chanel\" vibe and looks so chic. i plan on wearing it with just about everything. i would probably wear it open most times, but i love the closure with the button detail. i am large busted, but petite, 119 lbs., 5\\'2\", and this was way more flattering on me than most jackets. normally, the sleeves are too long, but these were just right! i am sure i wi I did like this coat, however the material was just not what i expected. i was hoping for more of a traditional wool material, but this had a fuzziness to it. not fitted in the waist either, which might just be the style but not what i was hoping for. I was extremely disappointed when this arrived. it\\'s nothing like the red color shown, rather it\\'s a very dull reddish color. as other reviews have suggested, it is very thin and runs large. i have to return. I loved this shirt when it first arrived and i couldn\\'t wait to wear it. after one day of wear, i went to hang the shirt back up and it was ripping on both sides of the middle back seem. this shirt was not tight on me at all. very disappointed. I agree with the other reviewer about the great colors, but when i took this off the rack to try one, you can see through both layers of fabric. i thought, insulting quality, for the price. i imagine the holes would start after one wearing. Nicely made, pretty details, but it\\'s cropped fairly short and is rather boxy. wore with orange linen pants and it was cute! The fabric wrinkles so easily and any slight moisture or liquid immediately turns into a dark spot on the blue grey...condensation drips from a glass, gel deodorant, etc. i tried the cream but it\\'s very sheer. i had to return this dress-- not practical! I desperately needed some new work clothes, so i ordered this and a few other shirts online. this was the only one that fit me really well and that i really liked! it\\'s a bit pricey for a tanktop, but it feels really well made. the material is soft and comfortable and the ruffle details and the print are beautiful. the small fits me perfectly (5\\'7\", 150 lbs, 36a) and it\\'s not short like a lot of other shirts i try on, (which my coworkers probably appreciate since no one wants to see me flashing This is an amazingly soft and gorgeous sweater. i typically avoid this brand because most of their pieces run smaller on my frame however this not only fit perfect but it is a beautiful color as well! i prefer transitional pieces that can be worn multiple seasons and this one is just right. I ordered this in a size 1 which i thought would be a small and it was very, very wide. it is very short too. i typically wear a small and am 5\\'8\" and 132 lbs. it\\'s going back unfortunately. very soft material though. Do not buy this dress for full price. the design looks great but after receiving the dress, the material is made of extremely cheap slinky-ish polyester that you would find at a f21 store. the stitching is horrific and created an uneven \"hump\" on the back seam. just absolutely poor poor quality. The skirt is so cute but it runs pretty small.  the fabric is nice and heavy it is adorable with a chambray top. These run very small!! they are also short, almost like a crop pant. the fit was so weird that i won\\'t even exchange for a bigger size. I threw this into my cart online on a whim, but i\\'m not disappointed! and i don\\'t even wear rompers usually. for reference, i\\'m 5\\'2 and normally a size 2, and i bought this romper in a size xs petite. if you\\'re on the shorter side, i definitely recommend buying it in the petite size, as i feel that this romper would run large in the regular sizes. the fabric of the top drapes nicely on me, and the shorts are about medium length. i like the neckline details. the armholes in the petite size aren\\'t This is an absolutely beautiful dress, but arrived with several holes in it! It does run large as most reviewers noted. i opted for the pxs and it was still very large and the way that the elastic at the top hit me it bunched funny and made my chest look huge and i\\'m only a b cup. it added a good two cup sizes to my chest and it just looked odd. the length of the petite was good for me at only 5\\'4\" so the length did not overwhelm but the width was still really too wide. love the fabric and the lace at the hemline. it just wasn\\'t for me but for those it works for it is be Love this top! such a fun pattern and style. soft too! easily paired with a sweater or light weight denim/cargo jackets for fall. i generally wear an xs in retailer tops and purchased this in a 2 which is a perfect fit. it could be a tad more roomy in the chest, however the 4 would be too big overall. Purchased this dress to wear to new orleans in may...perfect with sandals for casual and dinner. so sad that it was not as i had hoped. the fabric is a bit heavy, and the sleeves are very tight (i have thin arms). the color is a bit \"off,\" as the background color is a gray, which doesn\\'t flatter the yellow design. i purchased the large, as this size usually fits me with a bit of flow, but it was very tight all around, especially around the bust area. going to have to return this... I purchased this dress to wear to a wedding in june. i am 5\\'4\", 32d and 120lbs. i bought the size 2 and it fit like a glove, didn\\'t even have to wear a bra. the quality is beautiful. the fabric, stitching and detail are top notch and well worth the price. the way the seaming hits you on the hips and but is very flattering, especially for girls who may not be that curvy. it accentuates your curves for sure. it reminds me of an old hollywood, wiggle dress. \\r\\n\\r\\nwith that being said the dress does h Very flattering, the material is not the softest but it\\'s an easy one to throw on with jeans Maeve consistently nails pencil skirts - i always know exactly what fabric and fit to expect, and it is flawless! the fabric is soft, lined, and has stretch. it feels as close to wearing sweats as you can in a skirt! the colors are beautiful on this - i\\'d say in person the colors are a bit deeper and richer than they show in the model photo. length is about the same on me as it is on the model at 5\\'7\" and got my usual s with no issue. this beauty will go with lots of different colored tops too, I love jumpsuits - except for this one. the fabric is blah. it\\'s between plastic and the material that they make flags out of. the print is adorable and the buttons up the front are super cute. the tie thing that\\'s just hanging there?  it\\'s a tie thing that just hangs there. it doesn\\'t  look good hanging, and it doesn\\'t look good tied.  this jumpsuit had so much potential. i\\'m definitely disappointed.  for sizing reference, i am 5\\'5\", 135, 34c and a small was perfect. This is a heavy dress - it\\'s surprising when you lift up the hanger how much it weighs because it looks like a light sundress. and on my frame, which is pretty thin, it hits my shoulders and then my hips and just falls... so the heft of it means there\\'s no waistline... it\\'s an odd fit. the color is gorgeous, but the lack of shape made this a no. I love this vest! it is a great color and the inside is very soft! i will definitely be able to dress it up or down.\\r\\nif you are in between sizes i would definitely size up if you plan on wearing this with a little heavier turtleneck/blouse underneath.\\r\\nit\\'s amazing! i feel so confident in it! Either this rouching is going to accentuate your waist or it\\'s going to accentuate the fact that you just had a baby and ate too much linguini. unfortunately i have 10 more pounds to go and sadly this dress pointed that out.\\r\\n\\r\\nthat said, i had to give it five stars all around because it\\'s good quality, design, etc.. it\\'ll be great but not for me. \\r\\n\\r\\ngot a medium and it fit nicely (with the exception of pointing out that i still have baby belly to lose)-- 5\\'3, 34d, 150 pounds. hope this was hel I\\'ve worn citizens for almost 12 years now, i keep going back because i have an athletic figure (my thighs and butt are bigger than my waist), and usually citizens fit and hug all the right places and are made with a certain quality expectation - these did not meet any of those standards, the ripped as soon as i put them on. the material seemed cheap. I sized way down and this top was still shapeless and tent-like. the sweatshirt fabric overpowered the cute, feminine details. I did buy these when they were 40% off the sale price. well worth it. they are comfortable, thick but not too warm. they are my \\'nice\\' home pants to wear outside. =) i love them. i got a large and they fit on the baggy side but not bad. i\\'m usually a large or xl. The dress didn\\'t meet my expectations, specifically the color, the texture, and the cut of the dress. although the dress was very well made, it just wasn\\'t right for me. I was very disappointed with my recent retailer order. i ordered the meleri eyelet tank and it had a stain on the front. i also order a dress that came with a tear in the fabric. sale items should not be damaged unless the customer is aware of the damage and accepts it in that condition. very disappointing. I love these jeans. perfect amount of stretch, perfect color, perfect weekend.  \\r\\ni bought two sizes smaller than normal.  a little snug when they come out of the dryer, but within an hour they are the perfect fit. This is a beautiful sweater with deep rich colors. i purchased the blue motif. the problem is that the model(s) are small busted, which allows the side panels and front panel to lay nicely and swing in a flattering manner. i am 5\\'6\\'\\', 135 pounds and a 36d. i usually wear a small in antro tops. i purchased this online, and was excited upon it\\'s arrival. when i tried it on, i was horrified. it looked like a babydoll maternity sweater on me. the front did not lay well (flat) at all from the chest d Very disappointed. the cutouts started to rip the first time i wore it. i\\'ve only worn it twice and i love it but the cut outs are embarrassing. I\\'m not sure if i only received part of this dress as a mistake, but i received the chiffon shell, but there was no slip as pictured. it makes it kind of difficult to wear when the entire thing is sheer. i had high hopes, but sadly, this is being returned. the xs is out of stock now, so i can\\'t even reorder. bummer. Love the versatility of the dress. very easy to dress either up or down. i\\'ve been able to wear it out for a casual day with a denim jacket and booties (just like the stock photo!) or even wear it to work with a black jacket and flats. the color is beautiful and the material is very soft and comfortable. absolutely love the cut and design of the dress on top. only thing i would mention is that the dress is a bit form fitting than expected. it definitely hugs your curves. Nice material, hits high waisted, mine was a return that was not repacked and was just balled in the bag and was so wrinkled that even if it looked good, you couldn\\'t tell. very disappointed to have it arrive in that condition-so not typical of retailer. I was very disappointed when it arrived and had elbow length sleeves. from the photo, it looked like full length sleeves. it went back. Ordered it because i am fan of floral dresses.\\ni found that colors are not as bright as pictured, overall color looks beige in real life. fabric has nice weight, not too heavy nor too light, it is not itchy, but not very soft either. good dress for colder weather. the sizing was right, i got my usual m and i am 5\\'10\\'\\' 145lb. the dress has a side zipper, but i did not need it. the dress is slimming and close to the body. the cut did not work for me: sleeves were too short, i had to pull them up t These pants are attractive but their material is stiff and feels like canvas. i like them, but am not sure that i \"love\" them. perhaps they will get softer with wear, but only time will tell. Cute and very soft, but the elastic wasn\\'t sewn in right. i took them out of the wash and the waistband was a twisted mess. disappointing for more expensive loungewear. I like the pointelle feature in the front. i end up wearing a lot of black, but this at least gives me the option to do a bit of color underneath if i so chose. i\\'ve worn this with white, black and blue jeans w/ boots. looks great. i\\'m 5\\'3\" and 125 lbs. i got a medium, but i could have possibly gone with a small. my only complaint is that it might be a tad bit too long. since i\\'m on the shorter size, i can\\'t imagine it would be too much of an issue for others. I was really excited about this skirt because i love the color. however when i tried it on, it was too much of a high/low. i am not very tall but this would look a lot better on a tall person. I thought this dress would be a cute beach cover up so i was excited to order it but i was very disappointed. i am 5\\'7 and i usually wear a size small top and 4 dress so i ordered a small in this dress but it was huge!! i understand that it is not meant to be form fitting and i wasn\\'t expecting it to be but when i tried this on i felt like i was wearing a potato sack. i feel like an extra small would have been just as bad. i was so upset. it also has thin silver lines through it which, for me, m This dress is of excellent quality, made from fairly heavy fabric. the drape of the dress is beautiful - the dress definitely works if you\\'re tall and slender. i\\'m 5\\'9, 32b, 125lbs, and i have the xs. When i saw this blouse online i thought it was so cute! i love the floral detail. unfortunately it looks much cuter online than it does in person. it has no shape so it is not flattering to the figure. it might look better tucked in or partially tucked in as shown in the picture, but it did not look good completely tucked out. i was also not a fan of the fabric. in the picture the fabric looks dressier than it is. the front is more polyester and is a little dressier, but not what i envisioned. t These are such a great fall staple. the silver color is the perfect grey-olive, and the texture is perfect. doesn\\'t feel like there is extra material like most cords, and they hold their shape throughout the day. the fit is just perfect, i can finally order pants online that i know will fit just perfectly. I have to agree with people who are saying this dress runs small in the hips. even a size 0 is typically roomy on me when it comes to dresses at retailer, but a size 4 in this would have been best on my hips. the size 2 was just a smidge too tight looking and loose on the upper half of my body, which made my waist look thicker than it is, i thought. my boyfriend disagreed and thought it looked nice, but i still didn\\'t buy because my life would not give me many opportunities to wear this thing anyw This is a great lightweight jacket. i really like the olive color as it goes with so many things. it can be worn with dresses or skirts which is what i mainly wear. i\\'m an anti-pant person. the only downside is the price. it\\'s a nice stylish jacket, but not sure it warrants the high price tag. it also doesn\\'t look to great buttoned up; has to be worn open. i do recommend it though. I so wanted to love this tank, and was so excited to get it in the mail! i got a size small (my usual) and it ran so large i wasn\\'t even sure an xs would\\'ve fit properly. the material looked lighter and blouse-y on the model, but in person is much thicker and sort of \"hangs\". underarms run large and are gaping from the body. i am sad to return this top because i love the color and idea of it, but it just can\\'t work on me! The quality and fabric of this dress are lovely, but unfortunately i found it to be very unflattering and shapeless. it fit me like a sack, i ordered the m and i suppose i should\\'ve sized down, but even in the s i\\'m afraid this would be far too large. for reference, i am 5\\'7 and 135 lbs. i have a curvy build so this shape dress just wasn\\'t right on me. i imagine it will look cute on more of a boyish figure. returned. Thought this would be great for a laid-back wedding in new mexico, but didn\\'t fit. i am a 12-14 and the 14 barely fit my chest and arms. not flattering. material did not seem very breakthable. had to return. better luck next time. I ordered this and hoped it would be a fun & whimsical sweater for this winter. instead, it\\'s just strange. it didn\\'t fit well. too short in the overall length & in the sleeves. the shades of the yarn were drab. it also didn\\'t seem made to last. it looked like it would pill/snag in a short amount of time. i returned it. i\\'d love to see a style similar to this executed better in the future. having a unique sleeve is a cute idea. The navy blue lines on my dress on the very top of the interior layer can be seen through the upper layer at the very top and it looks cheap. for this price, i would expect more thoughtful patterning. the fit is amazing, so i am debating whether i should keep or return. Very flattering dress but i think the black is more of a washed out navy/black instead of a true black which made matching this with other black times (cardigan, tights,etc) difficult. I love the design of this blouse and the pattern, but the colors are a bit darker than in the photo. the quality is pretty poor. i feel like its a snag away from being ruined and thrown away and for this price it is just not worth the purchase. sending it back :( \\r\\nit comes with a tank top; just to let others know. I first have to agree with other reviewers about the quality of this sweater: the stitch is pretty, but the fabric isn\\'t nearly as soft as i expected. it has the look and feel of a cheaper sweater. that said, the fit is pretty flattering. i didn\\'t have any problem getting the cowl over my shoulders as pictured by the model. i\\'ve been looking for this style of sweater, so i\\'ll probably keep it. however, it really didn\\'t meet my expectations for quality. I purchased this dress in the red color. overall quality is excellent. the zipper was a little hard to work because the lace kept getting caught in it. the neckline was also too high.  i\\'m 5\\'1\" and 107lbs. the dress fit perfectly.  there is was too much nude fabric showing through the dress. i feel that this dress isn\\'t versatile. to me this is somethings that would be great for weddings or bridal/baby showers. due to the lack of versatility and the fact that i wasn\\'t in love with it, i returned I wanted to love this shirt and thought i would based on the reviews. it runs really large however and while i love how flows it is i also looked pregnant. i am keeping though- looks nice layered under a jacket or sweater but alone i feel it looked sloppy and big....... which is sometimes just what you want so it is staying in my closet. These pants are so cute and flattering. the linen is substantial and the quality of the tailoring is very good. i typically wear a 26p, but they were sold out in the gray color, so i tried the 25p and they fit perfectly. this tells me that they run just a little big, at least in the petite sizing. i wish the rose color was available in petite. i am considering ordering the chocolate as well. Tried this on and loved it except for one thing -- the sleeves are split, so any movement reveals most of your arm, shoulders. which also makes it fairly impractical for winter/the office (yes, i could wear a sweater or blazer with it, but that defeats the purpose of having an all-purpose cute top.) why, retailer? this is a perfectly cute top and looks great with jeans etc., but the split sleeves make it a no-go. I was hesitant to buy this because it is double breasted which isn\\'t my first choice. that was the least of the problems with this jacket. i love sparkle, and i love beautiful detail, none of the elements by themselves was a problem. the sum of the parts didn\\'t work, though. the end result was an unflattering, confusing mess. the silhouette plus the frayed edges, plus the sequins plus the vent in back plus the huge buttons plus the double breast, plus the zipper were just too many things to go t I looked like i was going to work on a farm. well made, but seemed fit big. i like and have owned wide leg pants/capris, these were cartoonishly wide.\\n\\nneedless to say, they were returned. The sweater feels nice, but not as luxurious as some cashmere. for the sale price, it is worth it. found it a bit small, but still wearable. hopefully it will hold up well, as the zipper seems a bit delicate. overall it is a good basic piece. This dress has pretty colors. the top fit well but the bottom looked like an upside down umbrella. it has enough material to make 2 skirts and the big pockets on the sides make the skirt stick out sideways. the photo of model is from side, not the front. very unflattering on me. Love the movement of the blouse and how it falls. great quality material. Way too big and had a granny like styling. was very excited but ultimately took it back. Another cloth and stone success! love the back! denim goes with most anything! I drooled over this dress online, so couldn\\'t pass up trying it on at my local retailer store. while i loved the unique color in person, & the drape of the skirt (good quality, fully lines), i was so disappointed with the top of this dress! it\\'s very tight, ill-fitting, & just plain...weird. i can\\'t imagine the fit of the top being flattering on anyone, regardless of chest size. it\\'s a shame, because otherwise, the dress is adorable! I loved this sweater! it is a little thin, so i will probably wear a tank under it, but you could probably get away without one, i am normally either an xs or a small, and i got the xs in this sweater. the bottom is a little loose like in the models photo, but i really like it. I usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops, ordered this top in an s and it was so wide on the sides and huge it fit like a tent.  not even remotely flattering.  i thought about ordering it in an xs, however, i could tell the xs was still going to have way too much fabric.  back it goes. I loved this blouse, but had to return. i am 5\\'2\", 127 lbs. 36d. i found that the blouse was tight in the bust and very wide in the shoulders. the sleeves are puffy, which is fine, but the wideness is from edge of the bib to where the sleeve is attached and therefore the top did not lay flat. if you have wide shoulders and a small bust - this blouse will be perfect for you. i liked the material, it was thin but perfect for a summer nights. This is a very beautiful summer dress with plenty of lightweight fabric. i loved the colors and the design. i know that some other reviewer complained that this is polyester, and it is, but it feels like chiffon. the only two complaints i have are- 1. the dress is large, so go a size smaller than you would normally, and 2. this is dry clean only! if this is polyester, why would they suggest that it should be dry cleaned only? that is going to take a chunk out of the budget to get it cleaned. oth I have to agree with the first reviewer! i really loved the color of this dress and could almost have overlooked the lack of a lining, but when i felt the fabric expecting a nice lush silk, instead getting what felt like a polyster instead i couldn\\'t justify it for the price. i really liked the fact that a maxi came in petite sizes as well, but just couldn\\'t get over the poor quality for that price so back it goes! \\r\\n\\r\\ni hope the team members or buyers at retailer are reading these reviews Even on sale, this was just too pricey for what it is, which is a glorified tank. i liked the straps, but it hangs very wide off your chest. I ordered a size 12 and it was huge on me! very loose fitting dress. i didn\\'t like the material either. I am somewhere between a size 6 or 8, so i ordered this dress in a size small. mistake. too small. the color of this dress is so lovely. it\\'s between red and orange. will probably order it in medium. I so badly wanted this dress to work for me. the material and color is so beautiful. this had a \\'sack like\\' fit and the side pockets accentuated my hips giving me a broader look than i would like. My daughter loved this tee the first time she tried it on. since then i have purchased the white, yellow/lemon and rose pink colors for her. the material is soft, it washes well and it looks great. she says these tees are some of the most comfortable she owns and it looks good with shorts, jeans and leggings. My usual size was a bit large and baggy in most areas but the bust was sooo soo small. the button popped and i had barely moved. do not recommend this one for anyone with a bust. the detailing is very pretty though for someone that can make this work. Love this top! but unfortunately i returned it for exchange coz it was too small for me. hoping there\\'s a sz sm in stock. Overall, it\\'s a beautiful dress, and i really wanted it to work. but the material feels cheap (at least not what you\\'d expect for the price), and as other reviewers have mentioned, it\\'s just a tad too short. for reference, i\\'m 5\\'5, 125 lbs and the 2 fit well, but hung well above my knees. there\\'s no way i could wear this without unintentionally flashing a few people. sadly this dress will be returned. I read the other review that said the shirt was boxy, i didn\\'t think it would be a terribly big deal. unfortunately, it is. normally i wear a size s, so i sized down o an xs. the shirt fits in the sleeves and neckline, but the shirt is still very box and now super short. unfortunately, this is going back. not a good fit. adorable details but the fit is terrible. I wore this for a few hours, and while it i got compliments i ended up needing to return it after the seams opened up over the shoulder blades. the fabric is so fine that during the normal goings-about of my day it gave way. and no, i didn\\'t buy too small, and the fabric didn\\'t pull while i was driving or reaching for anything. This skirt fits like a glove. i\\'m 5\\'6, curvy and it is very flattering on my shape. its a good length and the material has some stretch in it so it\\'s very comfortable. I ordered this in size xl and it is now a favorite of mine. the sleeves are tighter on me than pictured. i\\'ve had great luck with this brand and was a little surprised that the sleeves were cut tighter than typical. the material has a little give so i was able to stretch that out a bit. everything else was true-to-size. the sleeves are a little long but i don\\'t need to cuff them.\\n\\nthe lace detail & the peplum are so pretty. it\\'s a perfect option for cold weather. it did shrink a little, even wit This top looks beautiful online. when i got it, it looks nothing like the pic. it\\'s wide, too much fabric, no shape and so unflattering. it\\'s definitely going back I wanted to like this and even considered getting it altered, but just decided to return. it runs big and from the front it looks good, but the back just looked like a big oversized, stretched out tank. it was so comfy on though and not sheer or revealing. so if you\\'re tall, go for it!! The color on this dress is absolutely gorgeous, the fabric is great, and the bow detail in the back makes the dress much more interesting. i also quite liked the length. (i\\'m 5\\' 5\" and weigh about 132 and bought a 6 regular, which came to a couple of inches above my knee....not as short as it looks on the model.) overall style and aesthetic, i love. \\r\\n\\r\\nthe problem with this dress is the fit. i tried it on in the store, starting with an 8. too big, no problem. tried the 6, still a bit large (gap This dress is super cute - and fits tts for retailer. i ordered my usual size small and it fit me great everywhere, however the arms are much shorter and hit me either wrong, or the model in the picture is just very,very small. i\\'m 5\\'10, 136#, 36aa, slim built and the dress fits, but the arms bunch up -- if i ordered a medium the entire dress would be too baggy (and it is a loose fitting shift). bummer, bc it is super cute! also, the material is loose crochet - my dress arrived with a pull. sad fa Wore this dress for easter dinner and received many compliments. it is delicate and if not careful the diamond pattern can snag. i loved the comfort and ability to dress up or down. i ordered the regular instead of petite as i wanted the length at my knees not thigh high. and it fit perfect at 5\\'4. I tried this on in the store and it was huge. i couldn\\'t try on a smaller size because they only had a 2 and 4. i tried on my usual size 12. i don\\'t think the embroidery is as pretty in person either. definitely not worth the price. I really like this sweater. it is surprisingly warm. it is not very form fitting (which can slenderize), but i enjoy layering with a lacy tank and don\\'t have to worry about sucking in the guy either ;). i\\'m 5\\' 8\" and typically wear between a 6-8, the medium was definitely baggy, i ended up with a small in 2 colors.!\\n\\noh, and the bow detail really does add a fanciness to an otherwise comfy/snuggle sweater. Absolutely stunning top! love! what a great buy on sale! i wear a medium/large and purchased the size 12...fits perfect! beware that the bottom has somewhat of a flair! the material is light so i would say this top is something to be worn transitioning between seasons, late summer to fall! These are very well-made jeans, the fabric is substantial and gives a lot of stretch with movement. i adore the extra inch or so in the rise of the waist, and they make my butt look great. however, these jeans fit like a glove when i put them on first thing, but within an hour or so of wear they are so baggy it\\'s like wearing a size bigger. i\\'d say perhaps buy a size smaller if you want them to fit snugly through the day. if you like roomy, then buy your regular size. This shirt is more stunning in person. the color is a brighter turquoise than shown & the details are beautiful. fits true to size & is very flattering/slimming. love it! I purchased this dress in white and am quite happy with the fit and design. not too fancy but definitely not casual either. easy to dress up or down and can be worn for various occasions. the fit is great, but i do wish it was not so lose around the belly (it truly is fine though). has more of the hanging feel than the fitted feel. very comfortable for an evening out. This is one of those dresses that might be better for those under 40. on me, the fullness of the pleats and the bell sleeve made me feel like i was wearing one of those dresses for a much older lady. i miss not having to consider those things. the red color is lovely and the dress is modest. i just think it will read a lot better on a younger chiquita. I am 5\\'3\" and the arms of this sweater run at least 2 inches past my finger tips. if the arms were not quite so rediculously long then i would definitely keep it but unless you are tall, it just doesn\\'t work. also, i felt the length of the waste was a little shorter than what is pictured online. sigh. I wanted to love this dress because the fabric is fun, but i could not find a way to make the drawstring waist look like anything but a potato sack.the model has her hands hiding the lack of a waistline I saw this en route to the dressing room at an retailer store and picked it up to try on. despite the store only carrying this in petites, i tried it on anyway and didn\\'t want to take it off! it\\'s very wearable and comfortable. the sides have boning which keeps the fabric from riding up or down. i have a little postpartum tummy and the shape and pattern conceals that nicely. \\r\\n\\r\\ni\\'m 5\\'6, 160 lbs, and 36c. i typically wear a 10 and bought this in a 10p. the length, waist and bust fit perfectly. This sweater is ok. i love, love, love bell sleeves so i thought for sure this would be perfect. i thought it would be a great sweater to transition from winter to spring, but once it arrived, i knew i had to return. the sleeves are not only bell but very long and the sweater fits chunky on your midsection. i like my sweaters more flowy. if you like fitted-style sweaters that are a bit roomy you would like this once. also, it\\'s a bit itchy for me-but i\\'m rather sensitive and if i\\'d loved this on I bought this top in two colors because i need more statement tops and thought the colors were different enough for a really great top. i have only worn the ivory so far and love it. comfortable, great style and solid quality so the fringe isn\\'t fraying or falling out.\\n\\nif i could change one thing it would be the itchiness around the neck opening. it\\'s not horrible but it can be distracting and mildly uncomfortable.\\n\\ni am really happy with the tops and can\\'t wait to start wearing the black one t So i bought this, even after seeing the other reviews. because i love the designer and their things are normally cute and different. this fits just as others describe. it was not flattering to me at all, 5\"2. had to go back. I received the vest and it was pretty much as pictured however, the color isn\\'t quite yellow; it has a little green to it, kind of chartreuse.\\r\\n\\r\\ni returned the item because it didn\\'t look as good on me as it did on the pictured model. this would probably look better on someone taller than me. This suit is well made, and is so darn cute. i usually wear a 6, but i am a size 8 in this (8 us size, although the main tag is australian size. they send out based on the us size ordered). the only issue i have is that i have a long-ish torso compared to my size, so it\\'s ever so slightly tight in the crotch, but not enough to make me send it back. i have small boobs, so the extra padding is nice. i\\'m and athletic 5\\'6\" and 130 lbs. After reading every review, i was certain i knew exactly what i was getting with this dress. wrong. i sized up from a small to a medium and the dress was still uncomfortably tight on my rib cage. the top is very exposing of the bust, and i\\'m small busted. i can\\'t stand wearing camis, so there no way i\\'d be able to wear this dress even if i sized up again to a large. for reference, i\\'m 5\\'6\", a straight build 134 lbs, and wear a 6. pluses on this dress are, i loved the green color and length of sk I was so excited to receive this topped then i tried it on. i am a petite and i normally wear an xs so i ordered it in both a size 0 and a size 2. it was huge! it looked like i was wearing a potato sack!!! i really wanted it to work because the fabric is absolutely beautiful! i am so disappointed. Such a great dress. fit is flattering. the small v cut in the front and beading around the neckline keep it from becoming a boring lbd. classy enough to wear to a funeral but can be dressed up with some killer shoes. thrilled with purchase! This cute blouse runs a little bit small, particularly for large busted ladies. i found the silk fabric to be less luxurious and more utilitarian. it\\'s still a beautiful blouse. due to sizing issues, mine is going back. I wanted this sweater to work but sadly it failed. first, the pink was way to sheer for my liking. the sheerness caused a weird color overlap on the stomach area. then the band at the bottom was too tight causing a weird ballooning affect. a shirt underneath could work but it takes away from the beauty of the knit. the soft pink is gorgeous but not good for medium to light skinned folks. I was able to get this on sale. when it arrived, it was missing half of the rhinestones. i am very surprised that this top would be sent out this way. it also was missing the little bag with extra stones. i\\'m reaching out and wondering if anyone else has experienced this and is there a store that sells rhinestones like the one on the blouse? any help from anyone would be appreciated. i hate to part with this, but where was quality control? The model in this photo should be standing tall, because this dress looks absolutely fabulous right out of the tissue paper! i ordered a small, and am 130pounds 5\\'5\"- the dress fits like a glove, and is a pull over style. the nude slip- lining connected to the outer shell works wonders and allows for a full coverage feel, yet nice breezy, sexy appeal. this dress can be worn to work, on a hot date, and even a nice weekend look. when i say slimming i mean it. the center detail- grabs the most perf'"
